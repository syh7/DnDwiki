```
Een oude bekende van de bazige opa 
is ook een stuk gaan zwemmen 
met een gebruikt stuk drijfhout.
Hij blijft weg duiken voor de ogen van hongerige vreemde vogels
die er graag op in zouden prikken.
```

- oude bekende = dagger
- bazige opa = Vusorin
- zwemmen met drijfhout = varen op een boot
- weg duiken van ogen = verstopt
- hongerige vogels = dieven

+ ask about situation in city

+ Also a lot of smaller animals stabbed to death all over the city.
+ Eyes look soulless

- Annika has a small mirror and instructions
    - Take a reflection
    - Show the reflection
    - Give back the reflection
