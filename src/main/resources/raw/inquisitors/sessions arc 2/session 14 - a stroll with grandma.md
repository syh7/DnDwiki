+ knock on front door
+ "Be there in a moment"
+ high shrieking voice says

- door opens
- old harengon with thick glasses and cane opens door
- says we are 10th group to come with "new info"
- others presumably were not successful

- picture of her with important people in front of town hall
- some articles about Elowyn solving cold cases ofter retirement
- also trinkets from all over the region
- every major city of the Sultanate, even some outside of it, further in the desert
- so she's well traveled, good informed

+ Elowyn returns with leather notebook
+ re-iterate what barkeep of SSR told us
+ including descriptions of people Ragout spoke to
+ descriptions fit with murdered people

- Elowyn says murderer abducts the weaker of the couple
- the victims were also unloved by their communities
- neighbours were glad the victims were missing

+ Jermaine does not fit
+ Jerry does fit with mutilating animals but supposedly inquisitors are the only ones that know about that

- Elowyn asks what we saw when we retraced J&J's route yesterday
- She vaguely recognizes something when we mention an old, ancient guard uniform in a back alley
- goes to get another notebook

> "Mag ik dat hemdje van je lenen" - Joey tegen Max

- eating her hard, dry grandma cookies is very filling
- goodberries but not as tasty

> "Weet je wat ook ancient is? De bibliotheek.
>
> Weet je wat goed bewaakt moet worden? De bibliotheek.
>
> Weet je wat baat kan hebben bij immortal medewerkers? De bibliotheek." - Max met een complottheorie

+ continue to warehouse

> "_Van buiten_ ziet het er vervallen uit" -Joey

- investigate around warehouse
- same fish smell
- boarded up windows + doors
- no way to look inside, seems someone put a lot of effort into no visibility (also boarded up on inside)

+ debate the existence tunnels
+ Elowyn thinks there must be a hidden way out otherwise it would be lot louder with 20 abductees
