- contents are not revealed
- instead Joey sends a text to Maxt + Evi

- marks are not alarmed, instead look to entrance of cave to Sylraen
- monks don't move from their spots

+ Door in front of Nota + Baariq closes
+ opens again

+ Sylaen casts Dispel Magic again
+ dome flickers again
+ see 3 crystal rods in the brazier light up then dim again
+ so 3 rods are still working to light the dome again even though fire is out
+ shit

- Nota yeets 2 daggers at a rod, then walks up to brazier, picks up the rod, and smashes it on the ground
- an anguished wail sounds as the diamond shatters
- these are the trapped souls of the missing people!

+ Sotark yeets 2 javelins at a brazier but doesn't make it fall over

- Jerry and compatriot step out of the dome
- Dome disappears, fires in braziers go out
- Jerry looks like always, but with a green light in his eyes like he's possessed
- the figure is race-less, humanoid that looks like he is made of raw elements
- there is an oppressing aura, similar to the necromancer basement in Sanos
- anti-healing aura?

+ Sylraen starts bullshitting
+ "Hey Jerry, Marge is looking for you. Shall we go see her, and you can tell us on the way what happened."
+ "Ragout, no hard feelings, we'll see you some other day"

- Jerry squints and grumbles: "Inquisitors"
- Sylraen to others, in a casual voice: "Run!"
- then gives a great example of what it should look like

+ roll initiative!

> "Je bent nog vol HP, toch?" - Joey, onheilspellend

- Five's prophet creates a magic tether to a few monks/cultists and Baariq

+ monks look at Jerry for permission to act. Jerry is the leader?
+ monks pick up soul stones, portals appear and they disappear through them

> "Baariq vindt Sylraen best oké, hij heeft meer problemen met Kwame" - Max

- Baariq can't run away because of the tether

> "Spreek jij Elemental?" - Joey

- Sylraen runs back, casts Hypnotic Pattern
- 1 monk is hypnotized
- Jerry's eyes flash and he is disappointed in the monk
- The prophet cannot be charmed

+ Prophet grabs Baariq, but not actually grabs _him_, grabs _his soul_
+ starts tearing it

- Nota runs back to throw daggers at the prophet

> "Go and save yourselves! Tell Laïs I loved him like a brother" - Baariq

- Sylraen is not so quick to give up
- inspires Baariq to not give up just yet
- Baariq succeeds on freeing himself from the tether

+ Invisible Sylraen moves a little closer to 60ft
+ "Ah, one returns" the Prophet says (so his tether range is 60ft? blindvision?)
+ "But not for long" - Sylraen
+ prophet turns into a chicken, Sylraen runs away again
+ Nota and Baariq also run away

- "Good to know you are here, inquisitors!" - Jerry shouts with glee and frustration

> "Wat een aparte combinatie" - Sjoerd

> "We'll see you around" - Sylraen
>
> "...bitch" - Sjoerd

- "I can guess your purpose here" - Jerry
- scary, because we do not quite know it yet
