> "Deze man (Conrad) beoefent origami, maar niet met papier" - Joey

- establishment is like a tavern, but with casino-games
- bard in the corner playing games
- few bad guys with weapons are forcing the bard to play
    - 17 civilians
    - 5 game organisers + table guads
    - 2 near the bard
    - Unknown amount of people walking between bar + kitchen
    - Ilmig

- 4 mugs of beer cost & coppers
- cheaper so people stay and lose more at games
- also order bitterballen for 15CP

- Sotark + Sylraen play a few games
- keep losing
- start to loosen tongues

- Nola is spotted by Ilmig
- is asked to leave if she does not play games

- Kwame talks to bartender
- does not get any info

- Kwame goes to Sylraen's table
- butchers the connection between Sylraen and the game organizer
- Sylraen pushed through - barely

- Sylraen mentions a friend named Jerry owes him money
- organizer + guard look uncomfortable
- willing to tell some info if Sylraen gambles more

- lose another game
- J&J were here before
- Jermaine was kicked for not playing games
- Jerry would beg money from random passersby
- do not know where they are right now

- Sylraen leaves the table
- Messages the bard "do you need help?"
- bard bungles a song from shock
- Says "yes"
- guards do not approve of the song errors
- bard owes 14 GP to the establishment
- bartender says Ilmig goes about the loan
- Sylraen talks to Ilmig
- because the bard is playing right now, he is working and thus the loan should be less
- persuade him, becomes 13.5 GP

- talk to Bard
- name is Garreth, nickname Grit
- human, like The Witchers bard Jeskier
- tell him that he owes Sylraen the money now, but that he won't collect if he stays free
- if he is caught in such a position again, Sylraen will come to collect
- If the bard needs help, he should go to the Spire and mention his name

- go back to tavern
- sleep

- possible plan:
    - follow J&J route and ask people stuff instead of just following route
