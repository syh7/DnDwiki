- Statue is of Ealune
- Dalynn goes to the tree
- it is shiny like gemstones

+ prison
+ that is where mutation happens, also where prisoners sleep

- guards training in open space around prison

+ in the west, see a dock
+ including a giant ship

- discuss how and why Ember came here
- Ember was a scholar at university in Agranomia
- Saw some notes on Imna
- was pushed away from it
- got research grant taken away
- decided to investigate himself
- got captured

+ he was researching what exactly happens here
+ did not know about mutants (yet)

- Ember says Dalynn will sail the big ship away

+ discuss how to get in the prison
+ 2 entrances:
    - main entrance
    - dock

- main entrance seems not smart
- Fly over the wall?
- swim to dock?

+ Ember does not know of any magic dampening effects
+ Ember does know you need Misty Step to traverse parts of the prison
+ Some of it is divided by pockets of void of another plane
+ Everyone can Misty step except Dalyun
+ She could Wild Shape, go in Bag of Holding, then one of the others can carry the bag, Misty Step, then get Dalynn out
