# Session 12 - Of Riddles and Runes

- during long rest hear hyena's cry (possibly change into gnolls)
- Dalynn + Dandy start dancing at sunrise
- run of joy/light appears

+ checkout unnamed lake attached to lake Wennja
+ no plateau
+ continue to lake Köping

- no plateau at Köping either but there is an Elven woman statue
- earth around statue is fresh as if it was put there today
- statue points to Neuneun, particularly to highest spike from Neuneun
- looks as if statue rose from the ground recently - maybe when we got 4 runes?
- plague at foot of statue reads: "conquer air and you shall thrive"

+ Fredrik climbs in a tree and jumps into lake to "conquer air"
+ makes perfect dive so "conquers ocean"

> "We have a wet pussy now." - Dalynn

- go to Neuneun to investigate spike
- high spike has no ladder but signs with pictures, aaracockra falling off a peak and a skull
- also text: no climbing without featherfall

+ go search for magic scroll of featherfall
+ 2 options: Mikeys magic shop or Alberta alchemist shop
+ go to magic shop
+ Mikey is middle aged aaracockra
+ discourages us to climb the spire
+ people who climb up don't go down alive
+ they fall down unconscious or already dead
+ says the "no climbing without featherfall" is a commercial scam by the Vale
+ people could not see what was happening at the top, because a dark storm would occur

- sells 1 climbing gfear set for 25GP, or 4 for 75GP
- need featherfall potion to go down
- Albert might have them, but temple The Vale will definitely have them
- Mikey has scrolls:
    - Bless
    - Greater Invisibility
    - Produce Flame
    - Detect Evil and Good
    - Ensnaring Strike

+ go to Alberts next, right next door to Mikeys
+ looks like it got patched up a few times ("oops, boom!" said the alchemist)
+ Albert has a top hat and a monocle, and an English accent
+ has no featherfall potions, but he buys them from the Vale, so we should go there
+ 1 flask is 60m, or 4 falls, for 100GP
+ The Vale is okay with bargaining
+ The Vale is excavating a cave in search for a temple/flower, so if you can help them , it might be cheaper

- sell periton stuff
- 3 antlers + 4 talons for 55GP

+ go to the Vale - it actually is Veil
+ female aaracockra with beard is named Cherry
+ brings us a to an aaracockra Kayakalakakkak
+ says we need only take on small step to get stronger (next rune? level up?)
+ 4 free featherfall potions in exchange for help
+ according to a myth, there is a sphinx with a black lotus
+ they found the sphinx, but no lotus
+ cave has become dangerous
+ not interested in quasit fangs because it's from devils
+ bargain 2 featherfall potions + 650GP in exchange for helping them with the lotus

- instructions:
    - go to Shattered Rise (Öfakkö's home)
    - go through waterpods to stairs
    - go in the cave, left then right
    - maybe a right again?
    - then we find the sphinx and a puzzle

+ sleep in Thorans Refuge
+ lose 6SP from cards :(

- go to cave
- find 2 orc children looking for their parents
- pretend our nose bleeds and move one

+ downstairs, enter temple
+ pictures of aaracockra on the wall
+ lake in the middle of the floor (next rune?)
+ go searching through winding tunnels
+ find footsteps from various races
+ humans, dwarves, aaracockra, but also orcs and trolls

- find room with sphinx and room floored with tiles with runes
- find paper with conversion from runes <-> arabian
- sphinx plague reads: "sphinx of black quarts, judge my vow: 10-7-18-21-1"
- Fredrik just tries tiles and steps on the wrong tile
- Fredrik jumps away on time
- tile falls in a deep dark pit
- orange tiles are not accepted?

+ 10-7-18-21-1 translate to "lotus"
+ find orange tiles with runes of those letters
+ they get pressed down but do not fall down
+ like a button press but slowly go up again
+ each party member gets one button, Faramar gets 2
+ press them in quick succession
+ sphinx's mouth opens
+ in it is a golden egg
+ Wacomar feels attracted to it, as if it is the music box he should get for papa
+ Divine Sense from Faramar: whole place is consecrated, and the egg is pure evil

- Faramar stops Wacomar from touching the egg
- A struggle ensues
- Fredrik falls into a hole, drags Dalynn with him
- Faramar casts Hold Person on Wacomar to allow him time to get EotM and Dalynn up
- get them up but Wacomar saves the Hold Person and touches the egg
- rocks start falling down so we should run
- get out until the stairs
- Wacomar tries to open the egg, Fredrik and Faramar tackle him, egg falls down the stairs
- Wacomar Misty Steps
- Faramar Misty Steps
- Wacomar Suggests Faramar should let him go, but Faramar resists (silly suggestion anyway)
- Wacomar gets tied up, drag him upstairs
- Faramar gets the egg
- Wacomer uses Telepathy to tell everyone he wants the egg
- Fredrik knocks him out

+ Dalynn investigates the egg (arcana check)
+ It is magic from the transmutation schoo

- go to Öfakkö
- in the meantime, Wacomar wakes up and seems less crazy but still crazy
- we tell him we left the egg in a lake and he goes crazy again
- knock him out again

+ Öfakkö says black lotus gives you eternal health
+ knows nothing about sphinx
+ does know method to make crazy man sane again with sage+parsley

- show him the four runes
- says the cave right here is temple of Kalaaf
- ask him about an evil object down there, and he answers a shifty "no"
- low insight so we believe him

+ Öfakkö says black lotus is in cave of Wailing Drowned, not in the temple
+ says sphinx of black quartz =/= black lotus
+ sphinx came from the desert, tabaxi-land
+ says tabaxi lived here and then left when aaracockra came
+ they left behind gold/treasure
+ does not know why kalaaf has a temple underground/in a cave
+ folk tale that aaracockra before having wings lived in caves, and then got wings to escape the caves

- Wacomar waks up after getting the herb mixture
- Faramar tries to hide the egg from Öfakkö, but he sees through the deception
- Fredrik tells about the egg

+ we need to find the fifth rune to get in the cae
+ we need to find the lotus in the cave to get feather fall for the fifth rune
+ does not compute

+ Öfakkö gives us a sign of Neuneun statue, says he stole it from the Veil and they'll give us featherfall potions in return
+ short rest
+ Wacomar went to sleep and dreamt signs from papa: "the egg is safe with the party, wait until you're in Itron, then get it back and you'll know what to do. This is one step closer to getting mum and me back to life"

- go to the Veil again
- give them the Neuneun statue and get the potions
- don't tell them we found the egg, but do tell them the cave collapsed after solving the sphinx's puzzle
- they say Öfakkö wanted to use the Neuneun sign for a crazy rituel, and Kayakalakalakal said no

+ go to Thoran's Refuge, get a room
+ Dalynn is a catgirl
+ Faramar gives the egg to Thoran for safe-keeping

- long rest

+ scale spire with climbing kits
+ wind is growing stronger and stronger the closer we get to the top
+ it becomes almost as strong as a storm
+ the clouds start forming a face
+ strong winds blow Dalynn and Faramar off

- fight against an air elemental

+ get the fifth rune with an unknown sign

- plan
    - short rest
    - chillax
    - go to Öfakkö
