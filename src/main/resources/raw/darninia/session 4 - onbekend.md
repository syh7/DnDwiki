- uncommon to take slaves along
- Frank has an amazing, horrible accent (FIRST APPEARANCE OF THOMAS!!!)
- Faramar + Dalynn to backroom with 3 other slaves
- "Thomas" + "Ears of the Mountain" go play dice with traders

Backroom:

- TweedleTwee + TweedleDumb (human + dwarf) are slaves of master Hector
- Might want to send a message in exchange for something (prob woman)

- enter password, enter black market
- two levels:    - lower level is chained slaves/animals
    - upper (entrance) level has stalls for most stuff
    - stream with two bridges, but fenced with doors at the bridges

-VALERIE IS HERE!
Walked in through another door and immediately walks out over stream

- doors are for privileged people

-------------------------

Black market:

- Valerie just went into special door
- Guy looking important (+ smokes pipe)
    - Elf named Armado
    - wants to buy all 3 of us for 110 gold
      Opens door to sewer system to discuss more privately
      dark place, random goods around
      Armado taps staff on ground and light glows at top

Small office in sewers (w closed chest in corner)

- divine sense:
  presence of holy object
  presence of evil object
  holy further away, evil is close
  no creatures
  moving into office, holy is further away and evil is closer

Office: nice furniture, serpent banner; books about magic in Elvish (spells, items);
shipment manifests; statue of lion; some books nog in Dwarvish/Elvish; lion statue has emotional value for Armado

Armado has some respect for EotM
Has a job for us:
some people wronged him + friends, he's in a discussion with people about prices,
wants revenge but cannot do it himself, wants 2 things stolen:
party at mansion in canal village, blue peacock feather
Von Mackenbach will be there, also Mayors son Eniores Iaran + Ando Iaran

--------

at party: someone from Mackenbach
mayor's son
canal master
unknown who canal master is
controls flow of canal
carries keys, unknown what for

next to mansion is warehouse
it's open to guests, you can see how canal works and is used for Itron
warehouse controls who enters, what enters and who will retrieve items
take book with above info
take it as warning

new password for next 2 days: Buick Maza

could get permanent permits if we also pledge to Malarit

be aware that we need to be dressed correctly for party

Invitations for Elena + Fulmar Perkan on behalf of Heinz Mackenbach + Mayor

leave for tavern

---

buy dress + tuxedo for Dalynn + Wacomar
go to Mohuls place:
tabaxi female ere, Mohul is away but on his way
female brings tea
Mohul returns
give him map, tell hi of Armado
Armado is apparently higher up in Malarit
Mohul is happy with info and sewer stuff
tell Mohul about canal master:
CM decides prices of goods sent overseas
carries keys to tunnels, supposedly tunnels are used to move between lower-middle
also possibly all the way inside the mountain
Sign for documents from temple is sign of Nanin, in the south of Darninia

Mohul wants Nalaya to meet his friends
friends apparently stopped the execution a few days ago (also woman with devils mark)

Heinz is part of Aristocrats
Mohul is part of the Sistser-tribe
might be interested in partnership w/ Plebs, but also wants to attack the black market?

Back to guild hall to get info to know how many people there are and see if Armado has a shortlist of Canal master
opportunities

enter courtyard, lots of fun all around with food
There's a man with 3 faces (goat, lion, -) mask on a podium giving speech about a slave uprising and how they are going
to stop it

- troubles in Fekrar + west
- organising unions

Frank uses Squirrel mask to tell speech giver to tell everyone here what is happening downstairs.
Speech continues:

- building army of former slaves + commoners
- try to combine animals with humans for more power

Frank uses minor illusion to create "boo" sounds
people follow "boo" sounds
"what is happening in the basement?"
"attaching wolf parts to humans? inhumane!"
people walking to basement, which is now protected by guards
sounds about aristocrat-exclusion, people are shocked

suddenly magic wall to prevent going in basement
Valerie walks downstairs and says to go home

----------

meanwhile in basement:
thief guard gets Noël and Loes and says he is going to get rid of them
takes them back to warehouse
Noël attacks him to avoid paying money and oneshots him.
