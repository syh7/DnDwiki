# Session 37 - Gravity Falls

> "When in doubt, cast fire" - Anneloes
>
> "The Dalynn Way" - Noël

- space between planets is ± 500m
- current planet is very cold
- despite many towers, houses and buildings, planet seems deserted
- other planet has a bunch of people walking to a big church
- more people than one would expect from the size of the planet
- maybe the inhabitants of this planet moved to the other planet somehow

+ Dalynn + Faramar investigate options
+ see nothing
+ not even a High Road sign

- Ember casts Clairvoyance on church entrance
- hears church bells and footsteps
- sees people entering, then sitting in pews
- at the back is a big golden statue of King Abigor
- the people are shades, not actual living humanoids

+ venture into the city
+ gravity is higher so walking is more difficult
+ considered rough terrain D:
+ go left on crossroads

- Ember uses Mage Hand to knock on a door of poor-ish house
- no answer
- Ember wants Wacomar to Eldritch Blast the door
- wth
- Wacomar says no
- wth
- Ember uses Mage Hand to open the door
- house is empty
- not even furniture

+ repeat with richer house
+ same result: empty house

- continue
- find a big square
- large, black stave in the middle
- looks kind of like rope but then made for humongous giants, who would want to hang up an art piece from the ceiling
- at back of stave is a ladder

> "Oh no" - Faramar

- ladder goes up into dark sky, out of sight
- also goes down, into ground

+ Dalynn goes down first
+ feels heavy due to increased gravity, but probably easier than going up
+ intended way to go?

- past first layer of planet, space widens
- center of the planet is empty
- almost like a fake planet

+ Ember casts Arcane Eye
+ sends it down
+ ladder goes down to a black orb
+ Eye cannot phase through so it's a solid orb

- maybe not the intended way to go
- go up again
- nobody is physically able to
- gravity too strong

> "We went through so many dangerous things, just to die in the Droomvlucht" - Loes

- Ember sends the Eye up
- arrives at a ceiling with fireflies forming stars
- there is a horizontal walkway going in the direction of the other planet

+ Dalynn turns into a bear
+ pushes Ember upwards

> "Yes this wor... - wait, I can hear myself?!" - Dalynn finding out she can speak in Wildshape
>
> "Oh no, our moments of silence :( " - Faramar

> "Jullie worden zo gestimuleerd door een neus in je kont..." - Eef
>
> "Human centipede" - Sjoerd (https://youtu.be/ozezG1zpxXQ?si=5u7Bd691mCzUZlBs)

- Party climbs up to ceiling
- traverses walkway
- goes down again

+ meanwhile Eye arrives at church
+ shades are still filing in
+ church does not seem full yet
+ almost as if shades are disappearing again...
+ Eye goes to find origin of shades
+ finds Rollercoaster Tycoon (TM) cars

- party climbs down to a central square
- notice this planets gravity is less than normal
- try to find out where to go
- Faramar thinks maybe we should go back
- Dalynn notices the very tall church tower is angled to where we fell out of the cart

> "We should create our own travelling circus, we already have a talking bear" - Sjoerd

- Wacomar enters church transformed into a shade
- does not see any stairs or ladders
- goes to sit in a pew

> "Is er een kroonluchter? Oh nee, het is een Protestantse kerk" - Noël

- party also enters church
- shades don't care
- walk up to statue
- Faramar tries mimicking the statue's pose
- nothing happens
- tries to see if the statue is magic
- it isn't
- well then

+ place on pew next to Wacomar opens up
+ strange, a shade was right there
+ forced to move over by a new shade wanting to sit down
+ looks to end of pew
+ sees shade disintegrate into nothing
+ all shades move over
+ uh oh

- Wacomar stands up, goes to middle of church
- every single shade looks at him
- lifts his disguise
- shades still look at him

+ meanwhile with the Arcane Eye
+ floated to top of the tower
+ sees 15ft. gap between tower and rails
+ jumpable? Misty Step-able? ropeable?

- so church has no stairs to go up the tower
- discuss how to get up
- tower is very ornamented on the outside
- Faramar thinks: "What if... jump?"
- goes outside
- jumps up
- misses tower, falls
- turns it into a perfect salto

+ What if... climb?
+ attach ropes to Dalynn's bear
+ start climbing
+ Dalynn just runs up the tower, frick climbing (27 athletics)

- arrive at top of tower
- it's creaking due to party weight on small tower
- see cart on the rails just in front of us

+ Faramar climbs ahead
+ throws rope to cart
+ it sticks!
+ climbs up to cart
+ finally safe ~~from Shia Labeouf~~
+ has to make a dex save?!
+ saves
+ nothing happens
+ sus

- Wacomar goes second
- makes it

+ Ember goes third
+ makes it

- Dalynn goes last
- transforms into big spider to ease climbing
- easy life

+ everybody saves the Dex save
+ sus

- cart immediately leaves
- travel through darkness to lit corridor
- has red carpet, lit torches and a few benches
- almost like a meeting room before someone's pompous office

+ short rest

- next time... Casgrad?
