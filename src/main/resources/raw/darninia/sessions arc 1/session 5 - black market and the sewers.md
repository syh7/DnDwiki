# Session 5 - Black Market and the Sewers

- Black market:
- Valerie just went into special door
- Guy looking important (+ smokes pipe)
    - Elf named Armado
    - wants to buy all 3 of us for 110 gold
    - Opens door to sewer system to discuss more privately
    - dark place, random goods around
    - Armado taps staff on ground and light glows at top

+ Small office in sewers (with closed chest in corner)

- divine sense:
- presence of holy object
- presence of evil object
- holy further away, evil is close
- no creatures
- moving into office, holy is further away and evil is closer

+ Office: nice furniture,
+ serpent banner;
+ books about magic in Elvish (spells, items);
+ shipment manifests;
+ statue of lion;
+ some books nog in Dwarvish/Elvish;
+ lion statue has emotional value for Armado

- Armado has some respect for EotM
- Has a job for us:
- some people wronged him + friends, he's in a discussion with people about prices,
- wants revenge but cannot do it himself, wants 2 things stolen
- party at mansion in canal village, blue peacock feather
- Von Mackenbach will be there, also Mayor's son Ando Iarann

+ important people at party:
    - someone from Mackenbach
    - mayor's son
    - canal master
+ unknown who canal master is
+ controls flow of canal
+ carries keys, unknown what for

- next to mansion is warehouse
- it's open to guests, you can see how canal works and is used for Itron
- warehouse controls who enter, what enters and who will retrieve items
- take book with above info
- take it as warning

+ new password for next 2 days: Buick Maza
+ could get permanent permits if we also pledge to Malarit
+ be aware that we need to be dressed correctly for party
+ Invitations for Elena + Fulmar Perkan on behalf of Heinz Mackenbach + Mayor

- go to Mohul's place:
- tabaxi female here, Mohul is away but on his way
- female brings tea
- Mohul returns
- give him map, tell hi of Armado
- Armado is apparently higher up in Malarit
- Mohul is happy with info and sewer stuff
- tell Mohul about canal master:
- CM decides prices of goods sent overseas
- carries keys to tunnels, supposedly tunnels are used to move between lower-middle
- also possibly all the way inside the mountain
- Sign for documents from temple is sign of Nanin, in the south of Darninia

+ Mohul wants Nalaya to meet his friends
+ friends apparently stopped the execution a few days ago (also woman with devils mark)

- Heinz is part of Aristocrats
- Mohul is part of the Sister-tribe
- might be interested in partnership with Plebs, but also wants to attack the black market?

+ Back to guild hall to get info to know how many people there are and see if Armado has a shortlist of Canal master
  opportunities
