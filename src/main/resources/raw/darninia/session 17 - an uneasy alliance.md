+ "Sommige rassen willen nu eenmaal onderdanig zijn aan andere" - Frank
+ only blue puffs are allowed through the door

    - bluffs his way past identification papers
    - bluffs his way past possible security questions
    - hides the Disguise Self spell by saying that Valerie is using illusion magic to hide a burn received the other
