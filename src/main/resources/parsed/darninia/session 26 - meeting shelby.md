- Only "the right person" in the sky, can summon it

+ We get white with a dragon to win
+ dragon comes to life
+ It's Shelby
+ Tell him our names

> "There was a racial incident" - Wacomar

- Shelby is called "Sagory, the Protector of Life"

- Says she went to Daguria

+ Shelby swore an oath to do no harm
+ Could maybe scare the beholder away

- Party climbs on Shelby and is flown away
- Faramar saves Wacomar from falling but Dalynn falls on the ground during lift off
- Second lift-off works fine off

+ EotM sneaks in, with Invisibility and Fly 
+ If something goes wrong, rest flies in on dragon

- hopefully
