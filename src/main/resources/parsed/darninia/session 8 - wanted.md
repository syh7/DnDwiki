- magic items are "lost" (next session)

+ trying to find a way to remove necklaces
+ arcana check: abjuration of 8th level
+ dispel magic did not work for NPCs
+ put on by random guards at prison, so magic items were activated before
+ try to get a dagger in between,but lifting does not work

- Aaracockra "Ölö" joins, says there is a legend about the cave:

+ A child was lost in the caves, kept crying.
+ People looking for the caves kept getting lost too
+ After a high tide, there was no sound anymore

- Caves are a living being, changing entrances at will
- If we go to [Neuneun](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nenen), talk to old, blind aaracockra who was supposedly in the caved (named [Öfakkö](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nenen#notable%20people))
- to get to Neuneun, take boat from Öreö (also known as Orio)
- Ölö got high on shrooms, bought magic items, got captured by guards

+ Nenen has storm tunnel where it's always stormy
+ Young aaracockra have to go through trials there to prove adulthood
