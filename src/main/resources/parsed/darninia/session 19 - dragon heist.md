- Fredrik throws yellow stone on the ground
- it breaks in two: it's a black stone with gold painted on
- put both sacks in bag of holding

+ our expedition in a few days goes to [Imna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma)
+ Imna is an island used as training grounds for elite soldiers
+ "Villains" also go there, but nobody knows what happens to them
+ they might be turned into elite guards

- Andarin joined this world on the island
- built their first city there, it's now ruins
- we need to go to the ruins

+ first we need silver scales for the potion to see in the past
+ there is an adult silver dragon on top of the mountain nearby, named Vector
+ the dragon was friends with [Iuna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/iuna)
+ went crazy when [King Abigor](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/king-abigor) did the Mythal spell and changed history
+ cannot speak anymore

- his lair used to be beautiful but supposedly is in ruins now
- Vector is usually out hunting during the day
- usually eats sheep
- Dalynn discusses Conjure Animals
- Vector hasn't been seen in a few months

+ before sleeping, [Faramar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/faramar-illitris) trains with some guards
+ rest does nothing
+ go to bed
+ tomorrow we will go to Vector

- Wacomar has other plans
- sneaks out of the room where he and Faramar sleep
- enters Dalynn and Fredriks room
- Dalynn wakes out of meditation
- Wacomar closes the door and quickly goes to the toilet
- pretends to be heavily constipated

+ Dalynn goed back to meditation
+ Wacomar tries again, this time successful
+ grabs bag of holding
+ silently walks out of the room

> "The toilet is my safe space" - Frank

- Wacomar goes to the toilet and tries to find The Egg in the bag of holding
- finds out it is not there
- puts the bag back
- goes to bed

+ morning
+ wake up and go to the mountains
+ Dalynn plays her flute
+ vague connection, but everything feels normal

- come upon ruins
- a woodwoad comes out
- "You shall not pass!" - woodwoad
- does not share a reason
- "there is danger ahead"
- does not clarify
- only Wacomar can understand him

+ an angry drakeguard joins the woodwoad
+ "I don;t protect you, I protect others from you"

- Fredrik shoots a "warning arrow" near the woodwoad and drakeguard
- roll iniative

+ Faramar takes 13 damage in one hit in turn 1
+ Dalynn casts Pass Without a Trace and we flee

- interparty conflict about who did what wrong

+ walk on
+ real narrow cliff path
+ get to place where the path is broken in pieces
+ there is a 35ft gap
+ use climbing gear from [Neuneun](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nenen) to get across
+ Dalynn still falls
+ drags Wacomar with her
+ Recover and make it to the other side
+ leave peytons in the wall for the way back
+ meanwhile, hear Vector roar and fly away from his lair

- reach entrance of lair
- see first room
- random jewelry and books, but no scales
- portraits of silver dragon, Iuna, animals, guard drakes, woodwoads, and people we do not recognize

+ Detect Magic from Faramar
+ Fredrik does not wait and picks up a book
+ Detect Magic shows spells everywhere
+ a spell is triggered upon touching the book and suddenly everything goes black

- Something or someone is trying to tie the party up
- Darkness fades, everyone but Faramar is tied up (DC 24)
- a vampire is standing in front of Faramar
- he is named Rhysand Rice
- a vampire with wings
- says he ties up unwanted visitors, so they can wait for Vector
- Dalynn calls everyone impulsive (hypocrite)

+ long discussion between Rhysand and party
+ Rhysand wants a pound of elven blood for 1 scale
+ also interested in books

- he hasn't fed in a while
- sometimes gets food from the woodwoad
- has known Vector for a long time, back when Vector could talk
- Rhysand is looking for a way to get him to talk again
- knows Iuna as elf, not Andarin
- Rhysand was a human when Vector was a baby

+ he will let us go if we get a blood ruby from Vector, that Vector hid from Rhysand
+ blood rubies are created when someone is cursed with a death sentence
+ sweet talk Rhysand
+ invites us to his chamber and unties us

- enter throne-room like tchamber
- sit at very big table
- Rhysand snaps fingers and table is filled with food
- Rhysand knows red dragon in Imperial bank, name is Pieter
- Pieter and Vector do not like each other
- Rhysand calls in Boris, a purple panther
- there is a brother somewhere, but no female panthers

+ Rhysand originally came from Drekaria
+ was banished, chose between death or vampire banishment
+ the blood ruby is a reminder of a promise to the king of Dekraria to never go back or talk to any citizen from there

- go to big window to see into the lair
- big giant dragon is sleeping
- blood ruby is next to dragon paw
- no loose scales in sight
- Rhysand offers 12 scales in exchange for the blood ruby

+ Rhysand only mentions traps when we ask
+ rude
+ there is a false floor somewhere
+ when Vector notices an intruder, he farts (???)

- Rhysand says he cannot go in the lair
- later on says he actually can
- big fucking liar

+ Rhysand will make sure Fredrik will not die or turn into a campire when we leave
+ Rhysand leads us to the lair
+ there are small clouds that form stairs and a bridge
+ when we step up on a cloud, it holds our weight

- buff [EotM](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/eye-of-the-mountain) as much as we can (Pass Without a Trace, Fly, Bless)
- he enters alone
- EotM sneakily flies in
- grabs ruby
- Vector wakes up
- EotM flies hastily away (360 feet in 1 turn)
- party runs as well
- fart does not reach us

+ Vector is mad
+ Rhysand is happy
+ Rhysand knew about the Alarm spell that EotM triggered
+ didn't tell us
+ what an ass
+ exchange blood ruby for 12 scales

- walk out of lair
- Rhysand will let his friends know that we are acceptable guests
- EotM flies back to beginning of lair
- yeets ruby back into lair
- heads back to party
- walk down the mountain
- cross the gap, take peytons with us
- go to hideout

+ Kora says we have a package waiting for us, from "R"
+ it is a painting from us with Rhysand and Boris
+ no clue how he knew where to send it, or how he made it
+ tell Kora what happened
+ it is a very weird situation
+ give the ~~Andarin~~ weird elves 4 slaces, split the other 8 between us
+ Dalynn gives hers to Kora

+ Kora says she knows all vampires in Darninia
+ of course she does
+ she is older than all of them
+ if they are created, she goes to say hi and try to keep them in check

- Kora knows about Dorian, the brother of Boris
- Ancient wise panthers, can become 80/90 years
- Dorian was caught by King Abigor
- Boris may be controlled by Rhysand, so [the Andarin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-andarin) are going to take a look

+ leave in 2 days on expedition
+ takes 1 week to get to Imna
+ might move on from Imna to somewhere else before we go to [Itron](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/itron)
