- wins 30GP
- they think [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris)+Faramar are in a gay relationship
- another win, 40GP because [EotM](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/eye-of-the-mountain) joined
- another win but they won't honour the bet

+ cat-[Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dalynn-lathrana) is in the hold
+ a [woman](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nalaya) is petting a rabbit, that suddenly launches itselt at [Dandy](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dandy) to much on him
+ Dalynn goes to defend
+ loses
+ Dandy lost a bit of its mane but no real harm doen

- EotM wants to rob the dragonborn, Wacomar doesn't
- Faramar and EotM play darts to see if Faramar will help EotM
- Faramar loses terribly
- it's only fair that he then helps, it was fate!
- if you lose so hard after winning so hard, it is fate to help EotM get what is rightfully ours

+ Wacomar goes to get support from Dalynn
+ she is very dissatisfied but also still a cat
+ Faramar + EotM go to nursery to see if dragonborn are there
+ they are there, as well as nurses
+ apologize for the hurt, apology accepted
+ we'll rob them later

+ travel through fields, Dandy starts howling
+ hear lion roar in the distance
+ stop the carriage, Dandy runs away, Dalynn follows
+ Dandy runs up to a full-grown dandelion
