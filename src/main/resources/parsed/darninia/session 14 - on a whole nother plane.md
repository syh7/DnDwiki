# Session 14 - On a whole nother plane

- put runes in slows in the wall
- entrance in the wall opens
- Öfakkö does not join us in entering
- he is not the chosen one
- supposedly we all are

+ Fredrik sneaks forward to scout
+ Finds room with pillars, bookcases with books in Old Darninian and [Neuneun](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nenen) runes
+ pillars ahve roots around them that give off shadowy, smoky trails
+ also appearing and disappearing ghosts

- as the group follows, the wall closes behind us
- Fredrik sees a shiny object and rushes forward, but gets called back by the party
- Divine sense: roots are evil, but otherwise nothing
- investigate the roots:
    - come from another plane "Nine hells"
    - demonic
    - have been growing for centuries
- shiny object = shining black flower from metal
- has hinge in the middle as if it can be opened
- Fredrik opens it
- adamantine metal dagger protrudes from the rose
- it is a stiletto-rose

+ one book is open on a page about the flute that [Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dalynn-lathrana) has
+ it is in Old Darninian, so take the book to see if someone can read it for us
+ Dalynn is putting books from the floor back in the bookcases
+ [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris) looks through the flute-book, it mentions a few places, contains maps, pictures of vials, jewelry, the stiletto-rose and the flute, animals (including fairy-dragons)

- [Faramar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/faramar-illitris) + Fredrik move to the next room
- altar with candelabra, silverware etc
- also a potion with flickering fluid
- big wings on a stand
- altar is encroached on by the roots, the entire room is filled with them
- only few pathways are left open
- move into the room
- Detect magic: wings + potion are illusions

+ Wacomar + Dalynn enter the room
+ Dalynn steps on a root
+ room darkens and hear a voice: "You are not welcome here"
+ dizzy feelings
+ suddenly we are in a different room
+ see a person in front of us
+ everyone sees a different persion:
+ Faramar + Wacomar see Heinz [von Mackenbach](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-von-mackenbach-family), he taunts them about their mom Esmeralda
+ Fredrik sees tabaxi traders who are trying to trap him
+ Dalynn sees her betrothed Rowan who claims she is his

- roll initiative!
- because we see different people, it looks weird if others attack
- as if they miss the attack but the person in front of us still looks hurt

+ when Fredrik lays the killing blow, the world trembles, our sight goes hazy and then blind as there suddenly is too much light
+ we're in a world with a lot of bright colours and coloured animals
+ Detect Magic is still on: sensory overload, as everything is magical, not from a specific school

- party looks different too:
- Wacomar is a Winter Eladrin
- Fredrik is a Spring Eladrin
- Faramar is a Summer Eladrin
- Dalynn is a Autumn Eladrin

+ During discussion of what is happening, Wacomar accidentally drops the name Heinz
+ Farmar saves the day by pretending Heinz is a trader in half-elves who tried to steal him

- every party member is wearing a necklace with different coloured crystals, cannot take it off but the necklace is not magical
- history check from Wacomar: we are in the Faewild, although it is a lot brighter than stories say it is
- everything is intensified
- Faewild is supposed to be the world of twilight, but the sun is shining

+ see houses in the distance
+ animals near us
+ Dalynn tries to add a colour-deer to her druid list of animal
+ scares away the first one
+ tries to look for a second one
+ suddenly the worlds shifts and we're back where we started
+ one of the crystals on the necklaces is burned
+ fives tries left

- hurry to the houses
- little girl approaches "finally! we have been waiting since like forever"
- brings us to a giant, Yggdrasil-like tree
- small house nearby, elven [woman](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nalaya) at table
- asks for help with a banquet, the big tree is dying and one of the people is a traitor
- as if tree is being pulled to hell-ish places
- it is possible to enter the tree, but it is a holy place so last resort
- in one hour a feast will take place, where the council members will eat and one of them might be the traitor
- Dalynn plays the flute to connect to nature, feels the tree is hurt very badly
- cries

+ the woman gives us clothing for the banquet
+ 8 village elders at the table that invite us to join them
+ everything is a little bit strange, but it seems they expected us
+ Dalynn expected it to be twilight, but people don't know what twilight is
+ sun just *snap* is gone and then *snap* is back

- all alders are Eladrin too
- 1 blue, 2 green, 3 yellow, 2 red
- Divine sense: blue eladrin is a fiend
- Faramar picks a chair very close to the blue eladrin
- apparently switching places to talk to different people is very strange here, but the party covers for him
- try to talk to blue eladrin
- he leaves immediately to prepare for the spring feat
- his name is Henk
- ask other elder where the toilet is, to mask following Henk
- while leaving, give the rest of the party a pointed look
- they make up different excuses to leave and follow Faramar
- Henk enters a house in the forest

+ With Wacomars help, Faramar and Dalynn enter the house invisibly
+ Wacomar + [EotM](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/eye-of-the-mountain) stay outside
+ party is split up D:
+ Henk is not in the living room, quickly get the rest of the party inside
+ Henk is not in bedroom or kitchen either
+ find a trapdoor underneath a rug

- EotM lockpicks a box in the bedroom, finds scrolls inside
- scrolls are in Sylvan and talk about "being better than the rest", and "joining someone", and "seeing her"
- in exchange for killing the tree
- go through the trapdoor after EotM snatches some diamond earrings

+ enter mossy cave, Old Darninian writings on the wall
+ hear voices from a corridor, followed by a scream
+ corridor ends in a big, lit chamber with big, black root in the middle
+ same black roots as in Wailing Drowned cave
+ embedded gem in the root
+ 2 incubi are torturing the blue eladrin

- roll iniative!
- incubi are very charming, and kiss very well

+ their bodies disappear
+ blue eladrin claims to have been captured and tortured for months
+ take gem out of the tree
+ right then we are transported to the dark place again, out of the Faewild
+ look like ourselves again

- another person in front of us
- Faramar sees his mom Esmeralda, and a scary, beautiful Wacomar, stretching their hands out "join me"
- Wacomar sees his father "you woke up your mom, come and join me"
- Fredrik sees his father
- Dalynn sees her beloved Mathan and says "join me"
- Dalynn fails her wisdom save, goes to touch her beloved and is immediately downed

+ roll iniative!

- out of the dead demon body comes smoke, encircling us, and we're back in the Wailing Drowned cave again
- black roots are gone, crack appears in the roof so light shins on the altar
- vials and wings are real now
- Dalynn is not healable D:
- put Dalynns body on Faramars shoulders to see if Öfakkö can heal her

+ EotM takes a sip of the flickering fluid in the vial, now sees the temple as it was ages ago
+ people worshipping everywhere
+ no one responds to him
+ tries walking around but further away from the alter it gets hazy
+ sees andarin symbol on the altar

- Öfakkö says we had the "challenge of Kalaaf"
- why didn't he warn us?!
- says Dalynn has "corruption"
- his cousins can wake her up but there is no cure
- she will die in a week
- there used to be a cure, but nobody knows how to make it
- months ago there were "weird elves" (andarin?) who cured someone, but they left again
- they were looking for a red-haired woman

+ go back in temple with Öfakkö
+ give him the potion, he takes a sip
+ wakes up from his vision, happy crying
+ he saw Kalaaf
+ had a different vision than EotM

- we came for a black lotus and hints about the documents
- black lotus is probably the stiletto-rose from EotM
- so we are done here

+ show Öfakkö the book
+ says it is written by the woman the weird elves were looking for, [Iuna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/iuna)
+ Öfakkö brings out a satchel with a lot of potions
+ flies us back one-by-one
+ storm is apparently gone from Stormtunnel
+ apparently a really big deal, and we evade aaracockra on our way down
+ in town we hear bells ringing
+ first wake Dalynn up
+ head to Rusty Talon, on our way hear aaracockra talking about the storm being gone
+ go to backroom of Rusty Talon
+ Räkän gets out mortar and pestle, makes a paste out of black flowers
+ Dalynn wakes up, feels very bad but is still alive
+ hearing about the corruption is a shock for her

- go to Thoran's refuge to get [Dandy](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dandy) (and the egg)
- Dandy notices Dalynns illness and gets sad

+ got to palace with Öfakkö
+ it's gated and a lot of guards are defending it from the mob trying to enter
+ Wacomar walks up to a guard to try and talk his way in
+ doesn't work
+ Öfakkö only wants to enter the palace because he hopes to get his ban restored

- head to the temple
- Öfakkö is let in, but not treated very nicely
- a pair of guards come in to tie his hands
- show priests the wings of Kalaaf
- "I've been trying to tell you all these years, but do you ever listen? No, no, you never do!" - Öfakkö
- priests are now convinces Öfakkö is right
- they're very interested in the wings

+ also very interested in the black lotus
+ the petals allegedly hold a lot of power
+ they offer 2000GP for both wings and black lotus
+ drive the price up to 3200GP
+ Öfakkö is disappointed with us but we get money
+ get a big chest filled with GP/Sp/Cp
+ give Öfakkö the rest of the potion, keep a few drops, so we can try and recreate the potion

> "Eerst was ik een hoer, maar nu ben ik een blanke, witte man" - Frank

+ go to Imperial Bank to have money counted and transformed to platinum pieces
+ they only handle stuff for members
+ Wacomar as Thomas tries to open an account
+ give the chest while they are checking Thomas' identity
+ it doesn't check out
+ they want 100GP to count and convert it
+ Thomas bluffs his way through to the member discount anyway (1%)
+ EotM gets the egg from Thoran
+ We exchanged 3267GP, paid a fee of 33GP, and received 323PP and 4GP

- to Stormhorn
- tailor is closed
- head to tavern nearby
- next boat leaves tomorrow at 0900 as long as the disappearing storm is no problem

+ Heurits & Meurits are sitting in the tavern
+ get Meurits to exchange the cloak for 325GP now
+ pay the barkeep to give them as much beer as they want as an extra thank you

- tavern is full, so go to guesthouse for the night
- scam them with Dalynn as a cat

+ Dalynn gets 1 exhaustion from the corruption
+ get escort from the guesthouse to the harbour, past a very long line all the way to the front
+ get on ferry
+ on our way to Oreo!
