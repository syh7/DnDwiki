# Session 28 - Critiquing Kengradt

- [EotM](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/eye-of-the-mountain) tries to attune to the bee-ring
- [Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dalynn-lathrana) tries to stop it
- EotM puts it on and transforms into a hippo
- Debate how to get him back
- [Faramar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/faramar-illitris) wants to hurt him to revert back
- [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris) + Dalynn want to wait in the hope he reverts eventually on his own

+ Talk to Derek
+ Said he was accused of stealing a ruby, but he is innocent

> "Only big bad guys are sent here, so just one ruby is not enough. We know, 'cause we are also big bad guys. What did you actually do?!" - Faramar

- Derek stole 3 rubies
- Apparently small bad guys get sent here too

+ Hippo Fredrik goes to the beach to "hide" in the sea
+ [Shelby](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Hofo%20Sgoma) brings Rat in a Hat and Derek to the mountains and back

> "Derek, if you ever steal again, Shelby will find you" - Faramar
>
> "Hypocrite" - NoÃ«l

- After an hour, EotM reverts to himself while in the sea
- Gets back to the rest

+ Guards are patrolling the beach, so they'll find tracks going to and from the sea
+ Surely they'll investigate
+ Prepare for them
+ They don't investigate

- Do another short rest because pussy EotM did not do one earlier

+ Dalynn attunes to the ring, it's a ring of spell storing
+ It is cursed: it casts spell immediately on wearing it
+ It is buffed: it can contain 10 levels of spells
+ It is cursed: it fills with 2 Polymorphs per day, so you can actually only use 2 spell slots and you might use it on wearing it

- Shelby returns
- Decide to go together, back into the lair
- Very "Stealthily" enter the grand entrance

+ All walls are back to normal
+ EotM walks forward, shrooms start shrieking, ignore it and enter lair after pushing over wall
+ See fallen enemies, bodies still lying there

- continue to room with summoning circle
- EotM grabs a bunch of scrolls in Elvish alphabet but unknown language

+ Go further down to the pile of bodies
+ Encounter a cloaker
+ Beat it no problem
+ Search through the pile of bodies for [Saphra](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Hofo%20Sgoma)'s body
+ Hear a large distant yawn
+ Search quicker

- Bodies are in half-detonated states, some more, some less
- Horrible smell
- Look over all bodies, Saphra is not here
- With a sad look towards each other, continue on together

+ Enter big cavern
+ floor is littered with random stuff so it'll be difficult terrain
+ Also bodies further in

- Continue towards bodies
- Bodies all look like fresh kills
- Faramar uses Divine Sense
- All bodies are desecrated, like some evil spell or curse put upon them

+ Suddenly a voice from above
+ "Looking for something?"

- Beholder?!

> "New phone who dis" - Loes

- An eye dooms up from darkness
- EotM enters into conversation

+ talking about tracing books?!

- Dalynn tries flattery
- Faramar joins too, but rolls 2 and 3 :(

+ Eventually butcher all the talk
+ roll initiative :'(

> "You are like the party pet " - Loes over Wacomar

- Fredrik insults [Kengradt](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Surroundings) to draw attention
- Fredrik uses the feather of a roc to help
- It works and summons a gargantuan roc that draws the attention

+ party keeps telling EotM to run
+ he keeps attacking to try and save party

- Wacomar uses Fly on Faramar to try and get the body of Saphra anyway

+ Fredrik is downed.

- Wacomar runs away

+ Faramar finds Saphras body at the other end of the cave, grabs it

- Sees EotM is down
- Misty Steps over to heal him
- Ends turn in front of beholder
- Gets blasted for 29 (7d10)

+ Everybody ran away safely somehow

- Run to Shelby
- Fly away to the mountains.

+ Angry discussion about sacrificing yourself
+ long rest fails for Wacomar + Faramar + EotM because of nightmares
+ level up to 7!
