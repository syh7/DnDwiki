- Says we need to perform a ritual on the body of [Saphra](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Hofo%20Sgoma) to stop the curse
- The body is with a beholder
- Cheng Ling says Casgrad is on same power level as a beholder

- Cloakers bring you to the beholder
- The beholder decides if you die or get brought to Casgrad

- We go to one location, they to another
- If they find them, they head back to get us
