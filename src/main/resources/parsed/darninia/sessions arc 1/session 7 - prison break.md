- their organisation has safe houses, this is the biggest one
- organisation: Sister tribe
- want to protect [Andarin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-andarin)

+ Get told story:
    - Long ago, there was another race: the Andarin.
    - They were the first humanoids in Darninia. Descendants from powerful celestials, some could change the sun.
    - This changed when [King Abigor](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/king-abigor) came into power 200 years ago.
    - History books say that he came into power 40 years ago, but the king before him is also Abigor. He is immortal.
    - He is scared of the Andarin and convinced all races to revolt against the Andarin, killing most of them. Only a few survived.
    - Abigor installed a Mythal-spell, creating a new history with a new god, Eureka. He stol the spell from "us".
    - The spell disconnected Andarin from the earth, preventing them from earth bending, although they can still perform magic.
    - Then Abigor found out some Andarin still live, and started discriminating against women and magic.

- The mysterious mark means you're Andarin.
- Cara = Andarin
- [Armani](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-voiceless#Notable%20followers) has book about Andarin
- proof of fairy taile is in documents
- Mohul was married to Andarin, but forgot after Mythal, but they told him about it and now he believes them
- power of Mythal spell is diminishing
- symbol of power also shows on men
- struggle to believe the fairy tale, since there is no real proof

+ captured people are Andarin
+ captured by adventurers in a cave system - they are the witches we heard about before
+ one of the captured, [Culoriana](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/culorianacora), is an original Andarin, one of three who survived

- they are considering joining [the Voiceless](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-voiceless)
- sister tribe = 40ish people

+ the hald broken flute from Dalynn is the flute of [Iuna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/iuna)
+ was used to create the Darninian forest, used to communicate with the plants + animals
+ break the Mythal spell to unlock its full potential
+ prison is still in construction
+ intended to capture and hold magic users
+ most prisoners will work construction, important prisoners are not allowed to
+ give or take 20 guards
+ there was an archmage that put spells around the prison
+ currently mostly construction managers, so no real good guards

- plan:
    - Wacomar + Dalynn go in invisible, gather information on manager so Wacomar can impoersonate him
    - EotM + Faramar go up by the rope and kill guards
    - Wacomar + Dalynn release prisoners
    - then leave
- we get 300GP + magic items in return
- 150GP up front

+ first go to Armani and at nightfall do the prison break

- to Armani
- entering the guild hall, there are a few city guards trailing us
- they are "on a mission", investigating rumours of thugs
- talk our way out of it, but they still look at us
- Wacomar + EotM talk to guards to disctract them while dalynn + Faramar head inside
- get caught, but bluff our way through
- Wacomar "suggest"s that they investigate rumours about tabaxi now

+ Faramar + Dalynn are hailed as heroes!c
+ Wacomar + EotM join them (not hailed as heroes)

- asked to join Armani in his office
- break-in is bygones
- divine sense: evil object is still there
- Armani asks us to join his faction
- gives us permits for mid-level + 2 slave permits for fake names from party

    - better housing
    - salary
    - easier travel
    - certain items that are difficult to get

    - bring support for Plebs
    - magical binding to join
    - do assignments
- it is possible to leave, but required magical oath of secrecy

+ offer to go hom to think about it, then come back in a few days and discuss further

- get same payment, just more permits on different names
- they're used in different cities
