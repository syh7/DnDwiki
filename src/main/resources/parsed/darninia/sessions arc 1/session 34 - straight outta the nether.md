# Session 34 - Straight outta the Nether

- Andonorotes is a 17-year-old supporter of [Andarin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-andarin)
- told his father
- father is Duke Iarann, mayor of [Itron](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/itron)

> "17 is gewoon verantwoordelijk voor je eigen acties" - Loes

- short rest before leaving
- level up to level 8!

- chwinga's take us up
- end up back at tower prison, with Ulaf & Ola

+ Boldor is in the Nether
+ we were supposed to "slay him on the way"
+ maybe it will still happen?

- small problem
- few spell slots left
- need to Misty Step through mists
- enemies are outside the tower
- enemies are inside the Nether
- long resting in tower seems unwise

+ remember [Casgrad](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Casgrads%20Lair)'s tower in the north
+ Andarin are probably there

- people have more spell slots than they originally said
- enough to Misty Step
- decide to go outside

+ [Ember](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/ember-cinderquarry) puts on armour

- [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris) Misty Steps, rest in Bag of Holding

+ Wacomar makes the rest Invisible
+ pretends to be a guard
+ walk outside prison tower
+ walk out of prison fort
+ nobody cares about a single guard, plan goes off without a hitch

- Ulaf + Ola stand outside, just looking
- to avoid suspicion, continue on path to shack

+ quicklings follow Wacomar
+ debate killing them or letting them see us go north

- enter shack
- quicklings stay outside

+ Ember casts Leomund's Tiny Hut
+ this way we can rest, and when quicklings enter shack, we'll be "gone"

- discover Tiny Hut fully envelops shack
- more discussion

+ decide to just ignore them and go north
+ more discussion

- decide to try and sneak past and otherwise accept they see us
- Wacomar casts Invisibility on Ember, [Faramar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/faramar-illitris) and himself
- [Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dalynn-lathrana) wild shapes in a mosquito

+ roll stealth
+ everyone rolls a nat 20
+ quicklings don't notice shit

- go north
- see black tower
- black rails like rollercoasters/minecarts rails going from top of tower to 3/4th of tower

+ decide to camp before going in
+ talk between party

- already know when+how Ember came here
- now wants to get out to kill the king as revenge
- "the establishment imprisoned me"

> "Genocide vind ik niet to chill" - NoÃ«l

- "De goden liegen nooit" - Ember
- debatable
- given there is only 1 god

+ it's also dear why Dalynn is here
+ (she is in league with the Andarin)

- less clear why Wacomar and Faramar are here
- not willing to spill about the [von Mackenbach](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-von-mackenbach-family) story
- tell Ember we're here for the money
- he believes it
