- invite him to eat with us
- says Casgrad is annoyed with us
- we're smarter than he anticipated

- Dalynn asked where he went after we met in the dragon lair

- chit-chat with Rhysand while Ember casts Augury
- says he brought the painting to us by old vampire magic

- Ember's Augury's Omen:
- butterfly enters, sits on Dalynn's hand
- that's surely a good sign
- bursts in flames
- that's surely a bag sign
