# Session 40 - Leaving Imna

- Sleep music box puts everyone to sleep except [Iuna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/iuna)
- this also [the Andarin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-andarin) and Elves who are immune to Sleep magic
- so the box ignores it somehow?
- Iuna presumably not asleep because she opened it
- [Faramar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/faramar-illitris) takes it with him

> "Ik wil het aangeboden krijgen, maar accepteer het niet" - [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris) over omhelzingen

+ discussion about what to do
+ Andarin want to leave and come back tomorrow
+ Faramar wants to demolish the spellbook and phylactery now while we're here and then get the hell out of here
+ rest of party joins the Andarin

- move to buffet room
- [Ember](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/ember-cinderquarry) starts casting Leomund's tinmy Hut

+ Andarin remember getting caught in the library
+ being brought to the prison
+ then some magical sleep
+ then waking up in the middle of our fight with [Casgrad](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Casgrads%20Lair)

> "You guys are truly courageous" - Andarin
>
> "Yeah, I also kinda swore a life oath" - [Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dalynn-lathrana)

- Faramar asks [Kora](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/culorianacora) why she didn't cast Gate: Iuna before
- Kora says the curse prohibits her from casting higher magic
- but the curse somehow has a lesser effect here in the fake-Feywild

> "Curse? What curse?" - Loes forgetting about the main plot of the entire campaign

+ quick reminder
+ needed to find Iuna because she had the documents
+ documents are worth 50.000 GP to the king
+ Andarin say the counter-curse is in the documents

- currently 2 issues
    - the phylactery of Casgrad, who will come back in 10ish days according to Iuna
    - finding the documents

+ Iuna says she does not have the documents anymore
+ sent them to a different plane when she was in a pinch
+ "Which plane?"
+ "Uhh... a different one"
+ very helpful

- Iuna was looking for the 3rd Ancient Andarin
- named [Rionai](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/rionai)
- small problem: Rionai probably does not remember anything right now
- Kora and Iuna are immortal, can only be killed. Rionai lives a natural life and is then reincarnated without memory of previous life
- Kora and Iuna can make her remember
- Iuna knows Rionai is currently alive in Daguria
- birthplace of Dalynn, who remembers a child named Rionai

+ Iuna says Rionai has been banned for witchcraft
+ this confuses Dalynn
+ magic has not been outlawed in Daguria, why would she be banned
+ Iuna says a lot can change in little time with the tutelage of this king

- regarding Casgrad:
- Iuna "knows a trick" to take care of the phylactery and the spellbook
- does not want to elaborate
- Faramar persuades her to elaborate
- Iuna wants to burn [Imna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma) to the ground using magical fire
- what about the [kirin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Ki-Rin%20Village)?
- Andarin will get Kirin and the slaves off of the island

> "I am not very impressed with this proposal" - Ember

- Out-Of-Game decide to not hamper to much with this plan
- DM says this will work and Andarin will get Kirin and slaves out of here
- then we can all move on and leave Imna

> "Nee, Imna is maar een paar dagen vliegen van Utrecht" - Eef

+ tell Andarin about the [Abigor](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/king-abigor)'s war plans we found in Casgrad's study
+ Abigor is going to attack all of Andarin's allies in [Itron](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/itron), and let them run away to the caves
+ to then bring down an entire army on the cave to demolish them for the last time
+ Kora + the 4 lesser Andarin leave immediately to help in Itron
+ Iuna will stay here to take care of Imna's problems

- we will go to find Rionai in Daguria
- decide to ask [Shelby](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/imnahofo-sgoma#Hofo%20Sgoma) if they want to be our airbus again

> "Where did I park my dragon?" - loes

> "I _will_ know, and I _will_ judge" - Sjoerd tegen Frank

> "Eef is het best te verstaan van iedereen" - Loes
>
> Vijf seconden later
>
> "Wat zei je Eef?" - Loes

- long rest with 9 people in a Tiny Hut

+ morning after
+ extra doors appeared in the room
+ sus

- one leads to a long staircase up
- probably to the beginning
- another to the pantry with food of the buffet
- unfortunately food is not magical anymore
- there is a potion of Gaseous Form though, which is taken by Ember

> "Ik was dermate gedesoriënteerd dat ik disadvantage had" - Noël
>
> "Ik was dermate gedesoriënteerd dat niet iedereen even schoon bleef" - Sjoerd

- climb the staircase
- arrive at hallway with a lot of paintings
- enter through [Rhysand](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/itron#Notable%20People)'s painting
- of course

+ Ulaf and Ola are chilling there
+ ridiculously surprised to see us
+ run away immediately
+ pussies

- quick detour to Villa Volta to get back Dalynn's dress from "this bitch"
- this bitch is a dead skeleton on the floor now
- this very easy

+ walk out of the prison
+ need to long rest before getting to Shelby
+ Ember decides to cast Contact Other Plane
+ can ask 5 questions and will get semi-useful answers from an omniscient being

- "Are the documents in this plane of existence?"
- Yes
- "Can we trust the Illitris' brothers?"
- Unclear
- "Is there a boat available for us on this island?"
- That depends
- "What's your favourite colour?"
- dfgdrfsgqhgrtev
- "Is Rionai alive?"
- Yes

+ Ember tells the party about the questions and answers
+ hides the question about the Illitris' brothers
+ they notice he is hiding something
+ everyone feels everyone is sus
+ except Dalynn, happily trusting everyone

- Ember takes Dalynn aside
- Wacomar follows invisibly
- Ember tells Dalynn about the trust-question, and warns her not to trust Wacomar + Faramar
- Dalynn says that the brothers are trustworthy
- just hard to get to know

> "Ze zijn zo emo" - Eef over Wacomar en Faramar
>
> Twee seconden later
>
> "Niemand begrijpt ons" - Wacomar

- long rest
- walk into the mountains
- find Shelby in the Kirin's nest
- snuggling
- they're in a relationship now

> "Dit is een ander ship dan het airship dat ik verwachtte" - Sjoerd

+ Shelby does not want to go to Daguria
+ it is the land of dragon hunters
+ also dangerous dragons that do not like peaceful ones

- Kirin says there is an old dock in the north
- not used anymore, so maybe we can find a boat there
- sounds a little bit like last resort instead of a place we would like to get a boat from

+ discuss ways for Shelby to bring us anyway
+ different places
+ protection
+ find a solution
+ Shelby will bring us to a valley to the north of Daguria
+ we'll walk the rest

- start flying
- encounter the storm around the isle
- had hoped it would disappear with Casgrad
- unfortunately not

+ magical effects start happening
    - magical darts attack everyone
    - Faramar catches a longbow+1
    - Dalynn transforms into bubbles
    - Ember casts Dispel Magic on Dalynn, who is blown away by the wind off of Shelby
    - she transforms into a swift and flies alongside Shelby
    - a pig appears on Shelby's back
+ get through the storm relatively unscathed

- land in valley north of Daguria
- Shelby eats the pig
- much to Dalynn's dismay

+ Shelby flies back
+ through the storm again
+ we see Shelby fall out of the sky
+ seconds pass by without any sound...
+ then hear a roar, and Shelby flies out of the sea on to the isle
+ thank god
+ almost TPK by heart attack

- Dalynn leads the way to Daguria
- she lived here, so she knows the way
- right?

+ small fight against fairy dragons

> "Ik mis want ik was te bang om Wacomar te raken" - Sjoerd
>
> "Beetje een loser" - Eef

- fairy dragons in the dirt, we move on
- go through valley following path next to a river
- path ends at high cliffs
- decide to follow the river
- Dalynn transforms into a Giant Snapping Turtle
- Ember casts Water Breathing
- follow Dalynn into the river, eventually underground as well

+ arrive at a small beach in front of a cave
+ need to decide, follow a path into the cave, or follow the cold river into a different part of the cave
+ follow the path

- slowly traverse the cave
- switching between places Dalynn recognizes and doesn't recognize
- following the path or the river
- eventually hear Dalynn say: "Oh I recognize this! We need to go right!"
- right is a dead end
- sad
- Ember looks closely at the rock, seems to be a man-made end
- go back, follow the river
- reach the end of the cave!
