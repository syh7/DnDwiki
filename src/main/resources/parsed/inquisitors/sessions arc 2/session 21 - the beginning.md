- Wouter and Max roleplay [Kwame](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/kwame) and [Sumi](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sumi) respectively so Sumi has more money to fund the Library

- [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) mentions news about Busr to [Laïs](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/lais-emeteria)
- his cousin in the middle of the desert has more information
- will be a 5-day walk to get there
- decide to wait until they can leave unnoticed for 10 days

- look at instructions to craft an inquisitor ring
- requires 1 GP worth of metal and "inquisitor essence"
- combined in a special forge

- maybe such a forge is here?
- look through the keep

- [Aeleanor](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/aeleanor) + [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark) enter the basement room again
- decides to put her ring in the hole beneath the 3rd painting about bookcases
- gets transported to another plane by purple magic
- sees a vision
- gets transported back
- for Sotark it looks like she was in trance for a few minutes

- groove beneath painting to middle is now filled with purple magic
- Aeleanor goes to see all visions

- 1st painting:
    - shows 5 dragons arriving in the desert
    - a narrator says that the world is in turmoil
    - 5 wise teachers decide to build a school to help the world
    - build a school far out of the way to prevent unwanted visitors

- 2nd painting:
    - dragons transform into humans
    - each has an amulet with the elemental rune of their magic
    - combine their powers to create a school out of nothingness
    - 5 dragon statues in front
    - wizards hang their amulets around the necks of the dragons

- 3rd painting:
    - it was a school filled with learning

- 4th painting:
    - a prophecy was made
        - darkness will stir
        - school will fall
        - faceless army will come, choas in the God Wars
    - school gets visitors that do not want to learn Good(TM) things
    - want to learn how to wage wars against others

- 5th painting:
    - the 5 wizards sit in their study
    - human male next to them
    - gets asked questions: "What did you see? What omens did you receive?"
    - he's their oracle
    - wizards seem older and wary
    - decide to seal the school to prevent more harm done
    - wizards walk outside, take their amulets from the dragon necks
    - school starts sinking in the sands
    - wizards split to walk in different directions

- once all visions are seen, all grooves are filled with their respective magic
- middle of the room shines with bright light
- entire keep rumbles for brief moment
- grooves are dim again
- middle now shows a weird, forge-like object
- also a letter on it with the Inquisitor insignia

- letter is from "A Keeper of Balance"
- wishes the inquisitors luck
- this is proof the library is real
- also that the inquisitors were somehow prophesied?

- Aeleanor + Sotark walk outside to tell what happened
- realize that the narrator was the oracle of the dragons/wizards
- also that the oracle was the one that handed the NG their invitations to join the inquisitors

- what game is being played here, through so many different ages
- from before the God wars, until now

- [Sylraen](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sylraen-morra) + Sotark remember that Blackwood wore an amulet with the elemental rune for wind magic
- out of game remember that the winner of the Arena games gets to wear an amulet with the rune for soul magic

> "I want a golden ring because I am the oldest inquisitor" - Sumi
>
> "No" - Aeleanor

> "My PrEcIoUs" - Gollum Sumi

> "The one ring to rule all the inquisitors" - Sjoerd

- Baariq + Sumi want to swindle commoners for money

- Aeleanor starts creating rings for everyone, because they cannot enter to do it themselves
- each inquisitor gives 1GP + a drop of blood on the gold piece
- gets combined into a ring

- Baariq wants to create a second, non-essenced ring
- to bury to remember [Vayne](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/vayne)

- Sumi's neckhairs rise when he gets his ring
- feels like the necromantic dagger
- "It feels Evil(TM)" - Sumi
- "It feels magical" - Aeleanor

- Dagger feels like it would nudge you towards Evil(TM)
- ring is balanced, does not nudge to Good(TM) or Evil(TM)

- all inquisitors enter room to see the story for themselves
- imbue their rings with specific magic by putting them in the holes

- try them out with mock-combat
- all rings have some sort of 1-minute power
- can be stopped early, in that case it loses its charge
- thus cannot spend 20 seconds now and 40 seconds later
- rings can have multiple effects, but only one at a time

- wind magic:
    - +10 walking speed
    - +10 flying speed
- earth magic:
    - resistance to physical damage
- soul magic:
    - resistance to magic damage
- water magic:
    - heal 1d6 per round
    - +10 swimming speed
    - underwater breathing
- fire magic:
    - temperature regulator
