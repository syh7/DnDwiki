# Session 22 - Inquisitors inquisited

- [Sylraen](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sylraen-morra) has read the monk soul book
- they've learned a new way of interplanar travel
- requires
    - something of that plane
    - a "battery" of soul energy
- book describes a way to capture a soul when it starts traveling, so it can be re=used to open a bridge to the chosen plane

+ they obviously killed someone to steal their soul for the battery
+ what would happen if you only took part of their soul?
+ Sylraen remembers Tiber's warning that fewer souls were arriving than should, thus the process seems deadly
+ thus you would leave someone with part of their soul missing
+ not advisable

- the bridge that is opened will be like the dome we saw in the monk's basement in [Sandhaven](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sandhaven)
- also like [Vayne](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/vayne)'s final fight!
- strange

+ discuss trying to revive Vayne
+ not sure he would want to be revived
+ maybe someone could cast Contact Other Plane to contact him

> "De verwarming is koud" - Evy
>
> "Oh no! Anyways..." - Joey

- [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark) tries making another ring
- uses a platje (platinum piece)
- his golden ring crumbles to dust when the platinum ring is finished

+ Sylraen tries his wind-imbued ring in the water
+ does not swim faster
+ speedwalks back to the basement to imbue it with water
+ walks back to the water
+ can swim faster!
+ walks back to basement to re-imbue
+ walks back to the water
+ can breathe underwater!

> "I am learning so much!" - gleeful Sylraen to Sotark

- go investigate the water port
- [Laïs](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/lais-emeteria) and [Freemo](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/freemo) stay behind

+ [Aeleanor](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/aeleanor) casts Water Walk
+ walk to the opening in the Sand Wall
+ notice a strange object on the edge
+ investigate
+ get closer to the form
+ realise it's the lizard that chose to jump in the water to swim away when the NG came to free the tower form monsters

- walk to the rocks in the opening
- not an illusion :(
- actual rocks
- very high
- no way through by boat

> "Cum" - Sjoerd
>
> "Vanaf hier sta je er goed op" - Joey

- Aeleanor realises she could carry the boat over the rocks by moving the water
- using Control Water
- [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) should also be able to do it

> "Baariq, you work in ways I can't imagine and frankly don't want to imagine" - Sylraen

- walk back
- about 10m walk

+ meanwhile in the village
+ [Beetlefeet](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sandhaven#Beetlefeet%20Ko) comes find Laïs
+ says 3 "friends" came by to visit
+ walked up out of the desert, no cart in sight
+ 1 stayed with Shelly
+ other 2 were right behind him
+ now gone
+ sus
+ probably Blackwood's employees

- Laïs walks back to the keep
- sees a person from the corner of his eye that does not look like a villager
- can't spot them when actively looking
- walks on to keep

+ arrives as waterparty arrives too
+ discuss what to do
+ split up
+ [Nota](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/nota-deef) + Baariq go find them in the village
+ Laïs goes to see if they left any magic devices behind
+ Freemo will provide overwatch
+ rest will wait in courtyard

- Baariq uses Disguiqse Self to look like a random villager
- Nota stealthes for a 28

> "Don't try to gaslight me into knowing what a train is" - Laïs to Baariq

- before anyone can even leave the keep already hear a voice call out
- "those look like the people I need to talk to"
- man in dark clothing casually chilling on the second floor
- looks like on of the thieves that inquired after the OG names
- walks downstairs to first floor

+ Laïs, Nota and villager Baariq move one to check on villagers
+ Laïs subtly reminds Baariq to check on Beetlefeet

- thief-guy does not respond to the Blackwood name
- asks same questions as before about [Ezreal](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/ezreal)
- we give the same boring answers

+ Sylraen asks where to find them to grow a relationship with what can be assumed to be a reasonably powerful organisation
+ "we'll find you"
+ not helpful
+ guy says to send an unmarked letter addressed to no one to any big city's post office
+ it will make its way into their hands
+ or visit master's teahouses
+ implicit confirmation of Blackwood

- Laïs walks through village with Eldritch Sight
- does not notice anything magical
- hears someone asking a question about one of the OG inquisitors
- approaches the corner, moves around
- sees another Blackwood-companion

> "Aren't we all villagers?" - Laïs

- guy starts asking Laïs questions
- gives same boring answers
- somehow guy thinks there is more to the story than there is
- Laïs is able to maneuver him to the keep

+ guy gets distracted by Sotark in the courtyard
+ Laïs is not here for it
+ tells him that he wants answers about Ezreal, Sotark did not know Ezreal, the people who did are inside so get the heck inside

- Blackwood goons 1+2 discuss their findings
- still think there is more to it than told (specifically about Ihn, who is dead)
- Laïs has had quite enough of it
- tells them we've answered their questions
- they should leave now
- gets increasingly irate

+ goons have to have the last word
+ "we know where to find you"
+ boohoo so scared
+ Aeleanor + Laïs guide them back to Shelly to keep an eye on them

- meanwhile
- villager Baariq arrives at Beetlefeet, Shelly and another Blackwood goon
- "Hello Ko, I come to give you your food as I always do as this is my daily chore I do as a simple villager"
- Ko is very confused but luckily also mute so the goon does not notice too much

+ Baariq pretends to be a dumb villager asking and answering dumb questions
+ does not have to pretend very hard

- guy starts getting a little annoyed
- first Beetlefeet
- now another simpleton

> "Die twee kunnen een slaatje delen" - Joey

- Baariq subtly casts Detect Thoughts
- guy is interested in more than Ezreal
- also in who is here, and why they are here
- Beetlefeet already told him our names but does not know more than that

> "For a guest you are very rude" - Baariq
>
> "I call it strict and disciplined" - goon #3
>
> "Ok" - unimpressed Baariq

> "You must not have been taught manners by your parents" - Baariq
>
> "I am not here to discuss my private life" - goon #3
>
> "You're a hypocrite" - Baariq

> "Ko is Ko and that is enough to make others feel pity" - Joey

- Baariq asks after their method of transportation
- goon gets suspicious
- Baariq lets simpleminded facade fall
- goon still doesn't tell

> "Ik had em zo graag pijn gedaan" - Max
>
> "Je weet niet wat de toekomst brengt" - Evy

> "Het is géén fysieke penetratie" - Joey
>
> "Aawww" - Max

- Baariq probes deeper with Detect Thoughts
- goon's name is Vaylan
- Vaylan does not like his thoughts probed
- roll initiative!

+ Baariq knocks Vaylan unconscious under the thick cover of smoke
+ steals items
    - light crossbow
    - shortsword
    - studded leather armour
    - healing flask tier 2
    - 40 GP

- moves Vaylan out of sight
- Beetlefeet only sees smoke
- Baariq dismissed villager facade
- goes back to Beetlefeet
- mentally tells Beetlefeet to say that Vaylan already went home

+ meanwhile
+ Freemo suddenly sees 120ft. of smoke appear in the mountains at the entrance to the valley
+ notifies rest of inquisitors
+ move towards it

- meanwhile
- Aleanor, Laïs and 2 goons also see the smoke
- "that does not bode well" - goons
- do not specify for whom it does not bode well
