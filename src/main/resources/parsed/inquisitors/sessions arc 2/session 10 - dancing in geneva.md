# Session 10 - Dancing in Geneva

- Guards are checking tents who is home
- Want party to leave
- do so

+ decide to follow J&J's route

- see blood trail going in alley
- find man with broken legs
- [Kwame](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/kwame) heals him partially
- man is leather worker
- man is hurt by a group: loxidon, deep gnome, goliath
- was hurt because of gambling debts
- Kwame gives him gold

+ continue J&J route
+ through festival crowds
+ debate staying partying but decide time is of the essence

- go to east district
- poorer district
- typical close standing houses with teeny tiny gardens
- see louche figures in alleys
- [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) goes to talk to them

> "And then war crimes happened" - Joey

- Night grows darker and darker
- Slight mist rises from ground
- Mist creates illusion-like shapes
- back shivers like predator is watching.
- See red eyes in alley on humanoid-height
- eyes disappear and bat flies away
- investigate the place of the red eyes
- old, ancient guard uniform
- traces of limestone
- barrel with fish odour

+ 3 men try and get money from us
+ they run away after Kwame obliterates one of them
+ [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark) throws a javelin at one
+ [Nota](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/nota-deef) + Baariq chase the other one
+ drag the last one out of the mist

- ~~torture~~ interrogate him
- wanted to enter thieves guild
- needs 25 GP as entrance fee
- decided to rob the party
- wrong choice

> "Houd je van dansen?" - Kwame

- turns out yes, and good at it as well

- see guard going door-by-door
- knock wanna-be-robber out
- leave the scene

+ go to talk to guard
+ just asking if people need help with anything
+ so guards aren't completely useless

- Kuame says thugs were in east district
- "Sotark heeft het opgelost"
