# Session 3 - Keep of Requirements

- Go up the tower

- Meanwhile, stab the spider-monstrosity with a vial, get some blood in
- floors are basically empty

+ eventually find a floor with a lot of stained-glass
+ one wall has a wizard with a sun above him
+ the wizard follows people with his eyes but does not react when spoken to
+ the sun moves wth him
+ see an air wizard moving around in a dance-like pattern, summoning a Sandstorm
+ next a water wizard in the middle of a lake, transforming it to sand while still saying liquid
+ next an earth wizard between buildings, stomping around, flattening buildings.
+ Lastly a fifth wizard stands in the middle of a crowd, talking, healing the ill, until suddenly a flash of green light and the people walk away, as if they forgot the wizard

- reminds us of the tale of Sense of Wisdom
- There was a magical library who gave knowledge and wisdom to everyone, but after mistreatment by bad children, it vanished

+ Wizards don't react to us, don't respond,
+ So continue to last floor

- looks like a trashed teleportation circle
- Could be restored
- if you know the sygil of your destination, you can freely travel there, if it is restored

+ Go back to talk to the tree.

> "Even the toughest shells will open up when they get love" - [Kwame](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/kwame)

- Kwame is going to talk to the tree
- On the way down, immediately end up on ground floor
- Skipped the empty floors?!
- Going up to see where the other floors went
- they were there
- [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) and [Laïs](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/lais-emeteria) investigate what happens to the floors

+ It turns out to be a Keep of Requirement, (like Harry Potter)

- If you go through the staircase with a floor in mind, you end up on that floor

+ On the ground floor, find out the lizard bit through his ropes and went downstairs
+ Sneak after the lizard

- Downstairs is a big room with columns, one iron door and one double wooden door
- Tracks go to wooden door, group follows - except Kwame

+ Kwame is "just checking" the iron door
+ Iron door has no handle, but a slight square impression
+ Kwame joins the group

- Open the wooden door, find stairs to a long narrow hallway
- See 2 holding cells, as well as 3 cells

+ At the end hear waves and see sunlight
+ Exit to a bay with small wooden platform
+ Tracks lead to the water

- looks like he tried to swim to freedom
- Now we go to the treant

+ Kwame walks to wards the treant
+ It talks in Evlish-adjacent language
+ Kwame sits down to try spiritual contacting
+ Treant slaps him

- Kwame ignores it and walks towards it
- Treant is confused, doesn't attack
- Kwame uses Hands of Healing, heals something in the tree

+ Treant is wary, does not attack
+ Treant calms down

- Kwame wil terug lopen, maar de treant creëert klein hekwerkje, alsof hij niet wil dat Kwame weggaat
- Kwame overnacht daar, maar mag niet slapen van de boom

+ Baariq haalt de workers van het begin op
+ nemen met zijn allen een long rest
