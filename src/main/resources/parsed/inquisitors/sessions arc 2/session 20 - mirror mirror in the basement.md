# Session 20 - Mirror Mirror in the Basement

- go to the Keep
- [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) tries to Pavlov Shelly by shaking a Yuan-Ti tail while Shelly is eating Yuan-Ti meat

- arrive to see basic facilities fixed in the keep
- party has a celebration with a big feast
- OG (Original Group) + NG (New Group) finally become OG (One Group)
- everyone is up-to-date regarding [Sanos](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sanos) and Five

- go to Keep basement
- insert disc in door
- door disappears, becoming wall in the process
- quickly pass through before there is only wall

- find room with 5 paintings
- can see outside room back to hallway, but not look in from hallway
- find grooves in the floor from each painting towards the middle

- 1st painting shows 5 dragons
  - brown (earth)
  - white (wind)
  - purple (soul)
  - blue (water)
  - red (fire)

- 2nd painting shows 5 humans wearing coloured robes
- 3rd painting shows a bunch of bookcases
- 4th painting shows faceless figures surrounded by darkness
- 5th painting shows a sea of sand

- below each painting is a hole, shaped like a ring, with an elemental rune in the middle
- maybe we need to find rings for each painting?
- maybe we should insert inquisitor rings?

- go back outside
- find out that you can go back in if you wear your own inquisitor ring
- not if you're not wearing one, nor if you are wearing someone else's

- currently only [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark) + [Aeleanor](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/aeleanor) have rings
- rest lost them or never had them :(
- do have instructions on how to make them

- goto the mirror
- try many different ways to get the dagger out
- eventually figure out how to work with the mirror
- say "mirror mirror" before an instruction
- literal instructions from Annika (from session 6)

- get the dagger out
- quickly put it back in as well
- safe place for a dangerous item

- find out you can make the mirror take someone against their will too
- DC 15 Charisma save to prevent it
