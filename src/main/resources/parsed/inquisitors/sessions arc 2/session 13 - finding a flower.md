- actual DnD after 3.5 hours of discussion of vacation, changes of rules, and DnD5.5

+ 3 possible leads
    - [Nota](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/nota-deef)'s underground contacts
    - detective/private eye Sharpeyes
    - check J&J seen at [Sand Sailor's Rest](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sandhaven#Sand%20Sailor's%20Rest)

- [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) in prison
- rest discusses what to do
- go to SSR and meanwhile wait to get contacted by Nota's contacts

+ notice weird flower behaviour in the plants under the window
+ Baariq had a flower like that
+ could also be Nota's contacts maybe?

- Nota goes to investigate
- sees flowers doing interpretive YMCA-dance

+ [Sylraen](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sylraen-morra) joins nota

- flowers are signing letters

+ Baariq will stay another day in prison
+ [Idrisse](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/mage-guild#Idrisse%20Oqora) will leave tomorrow at sunrise with another anti-magic monster
+ Idrisse has a flower so we could communicat
+ Idrisse says to take a long, good look in mirror given by friend
+ that friend is in danger

- flowers have paper in hands
- it is a wanted poster of Tommy, Annika, Miranda, Jerry, and Jermaine

+ flowers are waiting for answer
+ ask if they can send a message to the keep: "camp guards know missing, protect them"

- flowers change colours
- apparently different colours mean something
- flowers get out of planter
- run away in all different directions
- only regular plants left

+ Baariq has flower powers?

- go to SSR
- within 2 streets after leaving Nota gets Message'd
- Nota needs to come alone
- [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark), Sylraen, Kwame continue to SSR
- Nota will follow when she can
- if we miss each other, meet up in tavern Fried Fishie

+ Nota goes west
+ rest continue to Sand Sailors Rest

> "Haven by de keep wordt United Sand Sailor's Rest" - Sjoerd

- arrive at SSR
- see carriage leave in South West direction

+ tavern is mostly empty
    - [Beetlefeet](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sandhaven#Beetlefeet%20Ko) with fresh lettuce
    - few commoners eating breakfast
    - barkeep, human male Merrick

- Sylraen contacts barkeep
- J&J are familiar, ordered food yesterday morning
- saw their dog being carried away
- J&J went straight (east)
- left with homeless monk Ragout
- Ragout has been around for more than the 5 months Merrick has been here
- he is usually here every day
- sometimes he misses a day

+ actually, every 2 weeks

- !!!

+ Sometimes gives directions to people
+ Sometimes even walks away along with the people in the direction pointed to
+ actually, often in the same direction

> "Wij zijn de bounty hunters" - Sjoerd

- leave message for Nota that rest goes to Sharpeyes
- Sotark gives 1 GP to Merrick as thanks for his help
- Merrick greatly appreciates it

+ go outside
+ See Baariq's flower write message in the sand
+ "Hi, I'm Abel, master send me :)"

- out of game discussion to see how Sylraen feels about Baariq
- it's Complicated(TM)

+ Sylraen decides Abel should not be judged on Baariq's behaviour
+ Abel wants to be picked up
+ Sylraen puts Abel on his shoulder

> "Ik zie wel gebeuren dat Abel en Sylraen besties worden, terwijl Sylraen en Baariq enemies zijn" - Max

- Continue to Sharpeyes
- Nota slinks by, secretly saying things without other people noticing
- says that she needs to steal 25 GP to enter/join the thieves guild
- wants it to be one of us
- she'll pay it back
- "steals" from Sotark

+ next time: arrive at Elowyn Sharpeyes!
