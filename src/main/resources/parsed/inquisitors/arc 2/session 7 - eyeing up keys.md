# Session 7 - Eyeing up Keys

> "Als je 2 d100s erin doet, is het net een teelbal" - Wouter

> "Beetle feet? Beetle pimp!" - Wouter

- [Sylraen](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sylraen-morra) makes deal with Beetlefeet
    - pay 50%
    - always use Beetlefeet if possible
    - help upgrade his ride

+ [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) thinks better of Sylraen now

- Idea: create a Downie pass
- travelling between towns requires x tickets
- you can buy tickets, allowing travel without gp

> "Wat eten ze [schildpad]?" - Wouter
>
> "Honger" - DM

- Beetlefeet's turtle looks hungry
- Baariq claims to have "fed" the villagers "the greatest food they've ever tasted"
- Sylraen feels sus

+ Baariq runs back to keep to get a few barrels for the trip to fill with food/water
+ Sylraen askes Baariq what mage guild accords are

- Sultan banished mage guild
- killed the ones that didn't leave
- banished mage guild practice
- So plan is to persuade that Idris is doing ingisuitor work, not mage guild

+ Baariq teaches desert customs to the rest

- See Bulette travelling through desert
- [Kwame](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/kwame): "It's a good sign"
- Beetlefeet says bulettes have been trained to carry humanoids, even to fight with them
- Baariq wants them for the DTE

+ Get close to the city
+ See something lying in the sand
+ Get closer
+ It is a street dog
+ Get out and traverse difficult terrain to get closer
+ Kwame picks it up
+ There are markings on the dog
+ They look like markings beneath the fifth wizard at top of wizard tower
+ Cause of Death: single stab to jugular
+ Not necessarily done for ritual
+ Killed humanely, as quickly as possible
+ Arcane check: seems like it never even had a soul, it is so empty

- Tiber: "you found one"
- talking about animals that died but whose soul does not arrive in beast realm
- Happened never but recently started happening

+ "Of nature it comes to nature it goes"
+ feed it to omnivorous turtle
+ turtle is named Shelly

> "Kobe" - Kwame
>
> "The one" - Kwame
>
> "The one is a basketball god" - Sjoerd
>
> "That's why he is black" - Max

- Shelly is nu een zij
- Good for breeding program for DTE

+ Go to city
+ Shelly rests in the shade

- Idea: submarine desert convoy
- pulled by Bulettes
- A Bulette train

+ long discussion about Create food and Water
+ result
    - 45 pound food = 15 food rations
    - 30 gallons water = 75 water rations (1 barrel)

- Try and find prison because Idris will be there
- Prison is tower on small island near dock, only bridge to get there
- plan: just walk up and ask to get Idris free

+ The closer we get, the more magic is clamped
+ Persuade guards to let us talk to warden Keys

- Only allow Sylraen to go through
- Convince them [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark) is his assistant and Sylraen need him
- They take our stuff before entering the prison

+ Try and convince warden to let her go
+ She is scheduled for transport on the 19th - in 2 days
+ Capital expects her so warden can not let her go
+ Will allow us to visit her

- Trial in capital will take place after a week
- Then: "the gods will decide"

+ Cannot give us the name of who accused her
+ Implicitly says she was accused by someone

- Sylraen applies for visitor hours
- Other visitors can apply during the hours

+ While getting up to shake hands, Sylraen pretends to fall
+ While falling, bump paper off desk
+ Grab Idris' arrest report to read how they found out she was part of the mage guild
+ Read the name: Jerry
+ one of the reluctant soldiers from Alden, who followed to [Sanos](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sanos), who is now a refugee
+ Try and help pick up papers
+ Shake hands and leave

- Catch up rest with the situation.

> "I can read the Lippuh" - Baariq

- Go to refugee camp

> "Ik wil geen zandnegers in mijn stad hebben" - Max

- Baariq goes flower shopping
- Baariq touches a blue poppy, and it turns purple
- it also closes
- Without magic
- It just happens

> "It is a child of the moon, and so am I, we are connected" - Baariq
>
> "Truly unhinged"- Sjoerd

- Baariq does not explain

+ Continue to refugees

- walk by an alley
- 2 hooded figures are talking to a guard
- group of guards look around like they're missing someone
- Hooded figures have an icon on their clothing that [Ezreal](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/ezreal) also had
- an open hand

+ [Nota](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/nota-deef) sneaks closer
+ Hooded figures are threatening the guard

    - half-elf (Sylraen)
    - goblin ([Vayne](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/vayne))
+ Guard does not know them
+ Says they did not enter
+ So he is answering the question
+ Hoods know he is telling the truth (magic?)
+ Hoods let guard leave

- Nota tells the rest what she heard
- Kwame followed them before Nota finished talking
- Hoods are climbing up a roof
- Kwame walks up the wall
- Rest run through the alley

+ "Hey! I heard you're looking for me. Come down and we'll talk" - Sylraen
+ Hoods say to Kwame: "We'll see your friend soon"
+ Throw smoke bombs and disappear

- Sylraen messages: "Come back baby"
- They do not respond
