# Session 5 - Conflict

- Extra rule: if you overkill with a martial attack (melee or ranged, not magic), you can cleave or pierce a nearby damage enemy if you beat their AC, doing the leftover damage
    - for melee, another enemy in reach
    - for ranged, another enemy in line behind original target
- Extra rule: limited carry capacity
- Now we do care, limited list of items based on STR modifier

+ Will see how it works in the future
