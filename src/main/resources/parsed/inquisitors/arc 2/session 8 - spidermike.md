    - contact current leader of camp for discussions
    - check if property was taken and if so, what property and maybe get it back to owners

+ [Baariq](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/baariq) wants to use property to black mail people into going to the tower

> "Bad Baariq! No manipulating" - Sylraen Dora

+ He's not here
+ Bed looks like it's been slept in

+ There are markings on tent poles
+ Same markings as the dead street dog
+ Not magical, just playing with knife and wood
+ But still wrong, evil that it's these specific markings
