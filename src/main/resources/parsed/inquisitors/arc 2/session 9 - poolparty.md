# Session 9 - Poolparty

> "Vurzes is net als Beetlefeet" - Wouter

- Continue talking to Idris
- Thinks most people are unaware of what's happening (regarding green light)
- Be careful who you share info with
- no enemies she's currently aware of
- Sultan could go either way
- inquisitor group is unknown by anyone so no image to adhere to

+ Idris knows little of the hooded figures investigating us
+ they are called League of Assassins
+ Since [Sotark](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sotark) wasn't mentioned, it is likely not inquisitor-based

- Do not trust government until you know for sure you can

+ priorities
    - protect goods from ship
    - figure out the dagger (appears indestructible)
    - find the library

- Five from [Sanos](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sanos) had help then. Maybe has help here and now
- Those forces will oppose us if they find out we're looking

+ [Sylraen](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/sylraen-morra) and Idris say goodbye
+ Hope to see each other at the tower

- Sotark decides not to go see Idris
- Sylraen + Sotark go upstairs and outside

+ go to harbour, find a cheap restaurant with view of our boat

- Sylraen + Sotark point out the boat to the rest
- [Nota](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/nota-deef) notices a guy coming out of the hold, speaking to a guard on the pier, holding up hands like he found nothing, but he is ordered back inside

> "[Kwame](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Inquisitors/page/kwame) is balling" - Jim

- discuss plans over dinner
- retcon that Idris gave pointers to where on the boat we should look
- It's _near_, not _on_ the boat
- Sylraen looks at the water, realizes one word Idris used was "weggedoken"

+ Kwame has a smart plan to look for a diving store to help with equipment
+ Diving does not exist in this world
+ just jump and hold breath

- ask barmaid if we can leave ous stuff while we party
- we can

+ get 4 casks of beer + a few glasses
+ go to start of pier
+ Sylraen uses Prestidigation: "free beer here!"
+ Nota, Sotark and Kwame go over the pier to the end, in the meantime telling people there is free beer at the start

- On the way to pier, get a group of people following us
- Great party, Sylraen is playing his flute
- While the rest is swimming, Sylraen slowly tries to get the entire group closer to the restricted part of the harbour
- great success
- guards slowly lose their smiles the closer we get to the restricted access
- try to arrive at the same time as the rest arrives at the boat

- Kwame and Nota help Sotark
- Nota sees everything, even the history of the wood (30 investigation)
- Nota pries away a few planks find a black box, take it
- Kwame hides the hidden compartiment again
- swim back to pier

+ meanwhile in the harbour
+ alarm clock starts ringing
+ Sylraen starts giving mixed signals

+ "we can get in trouble"
+ "we can take the guards"
+ "run away"
+ Sylraen slips away to the south
