After a lot of practicing, slowly woodfolk started to gather around him when he started playing, mostly dryads, pixies and satyrs.

With the clouds came many kinds of monsters, all equally bad and destructive. Sylraens parents were called to defend the village, while Sylraen was left alone. Unfortuantely, the defense of the village was not enough and monsters started to overrun it. Sylraen got cornered in an alleyway by one of them, and in his fear called out for help to anyone who would listen. A lupinal, Tiber, answered his call and Sylraen promised to help him find and fight the origin of the dark clouds if the lupinal saved his life. A bright light glowed and the world grew white as Sylraen passed out. When he came too, a small group of the mage guild had arrived.
