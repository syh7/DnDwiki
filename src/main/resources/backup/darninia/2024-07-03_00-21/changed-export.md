#### Backstory

Faramar is the brother of [Wacomar Illitris](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/2), former members of the [Von Mackenbach family](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/10). After surviving an assassination attempt on the brothers and their mother Esmeralda, Faramar and Wacomar split from the family, who presumed them dead.

"The coolest player character I've ever had the honour of DM'ing for." - Eveline, who still has to change her password

"Wacky Wacky is the most bestest of all them good." - Eye of the Mountain, who still has to change his password

#### Character sheet

There is no up-to-date digital version. The paper version is leading.

#### Smokey

\[requested: statblock\]

Is a cute shadow pup that Wacomar can summon through the spell "Find Familiar".

Originally, we met Smokey in session 3 as the ash dog of Tathrana. In session 7 Smokey was first summoned.

#### Persona's

Wacomar's abilities allow him to easily disguise himself as another person. Aside from disguising into established in-game characters, there are also some persona's invented from the ground up.

##### Thomas "the Treasurer" Tancus Enginius the First (of Many)

[A depiction of Thomas "the Treasurer" Tancus Enginius the First (of Many)  
![image.png](https://bookstack.hemels.me/uploads/images/gallery/2024-07/scaled-1680-/J7Fimage.png)](https://bookstack.hemels.me/uploads/images/gallery/2024-07/J7Fimage.png)Thomas is a human male trader of treasures. He hails from Cape Coopvaert, a sea trade oriented city near [Membe](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/18#bkmrk-page-title). He wears a furry white leopard robe with black spots. He claims to be a well established trader in exotic goods looking for more treasure around the world, but has very few to show for. His most defining feature is his ferry Dutsj aksent.

Thomas was originally modeled after [Antonio van Diemen](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_van_Diemen). The 'CEO' of the VOC born in Kuilenburg. Note that this was created far before Frank moved into Culemborg.

##### Folmar Percan

Folmar is an elf male trader from Agronomia. He is almost always accompanied by Elena Percan, a disguise of [Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/3#bkmrk-page-title), with whom he frequently joins parties. As all Agronomians, they wield hefty defty French accents.

The fake identification papers were given by [Armado, of the Voiceless](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/26#bkmrk-asdf-asdf). They even posses permits to [the middle level of Itron](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/25#bkmrk-middle-level).

##### Sainterklaus

As a human slave trader of elven woman hailing from [Ha√§nda](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/7#bkmrk-it-neighbours-the-co), Sainterklaus once smuggled a large group of Andarin out of Itron. His thick American/Scottish accent was an enormous help in this endeavor.

# Dalynn Lathrana

#### Backstory

The fiercely idealistic impulsive Elven woman.

Alle kinderen van een generatie groeien samen op, right? Iedereen kent iedereen. Ik had een beste vriend, een beetje een nerd, niet zo sterk als zou moeten maar lief en grappig en we waren onafscheidelijk. In mijn vrije tijd las ik graag, itt \[activiteit die meeste jongeren doen in vrije tijd, idk, dobbelspel ofzo?\]. Liefde en dat soort gevoelens zijn in het dorp geen ding maar in mijn boeken wel. Gaandeweg begrijp ik wat liefde is en dat ik dat voel voor mijn beste vriend. Tijd van legaal worden breekt aan en dorpsoudste koppelt mij aan diens zoon. Hij is macho en ik vind hem vervelend, een opschepper en vindt stoer doen te belangrijk. Met pijn in mijn hart en tranen in mijn ogen verlaat ik het dorp en daarmee ook de unsuspecting love of my life. Ik kan niet trouwen en kinderen maken met die man en leven zonder het gezelschap en de genegenheid van mijn beste vriend. Als enige blijk van afscheid laat ik mijn boeken achter bij mijn beste vriend.

Ik reis eerst naar Agronomia, waar ik een boot pak naar de Forgotten Realms en leer hoe vrouwen evenwaardig zijn aan mannen. Ik kom weer terug naar de Darninian Realm om te proberen dit te leren aan de mensen hier, en ik land in Wedal. Daar ontmoet ik een Tabaxi genaamd Frederik Hendrik de 3e, die ik uitleg dat hij onderdrukt wordt. Hij lijkt het heel goed op te vangen.

# Eye of the Mountain

#### Backstory

A fast, sneaky pussycat who loves shinies (also known as Fredrik)

Frederik Hendrik de Derde - this name was given to me by my point of contact in the underground network. Makes you wonder about Frederik hendrik the First and Second, doesn't it?

Well, FH1 is my mother, and FH2 is my mother. The name was given by the contact to provide a sense of neutrality - people around here dont like typical tabaxi names. I used my own name for a while too, but I've gotten used to FH3. People dont look down as much on you when you tell your name.

Anyway, better get started. I've grown up in a travelling family of shady people. My mother, FH1, got involved in a criminal network. Never fully involved mind you, they don't trust Tabaxi enough around these parts, but she got assignments from a point of contact. She was the first, hence the name FH1. She didn't do any violent business, only stealing. Was god damn adept at it though. She met my dad FH2, in Fekrar. He was a poor sod, but strong and flexible. It wasn't all that intentional, but mum dragged him into the circuit. He recognised that more violent work paid much better, he mostly did hired killings. When possible, these kills were ritually sacrificed to Tezca. We were never really settled in one place or another, trouble always got to us. We're home when we're on the road, no one to backstab you when you're just with the family.

When mum got pregnant, she took her maternity leave and returned to Tabaxiland for a bit. We weren't rich enough to make ends meet for the full duration, so dad stayed for more work. He eventually also came to witness my birth, but it wasn't for long. The pay is good, but we have no education to hold normal jobs in Tabaxiland. We quickly returned to what I think is called Eliria. Mum temporarily quit, dad continued working.

On my 14th, I 'came of age'. I had learned vital skills to survive in this world as a tabaxi. I knew to be stealthy, and how to use words. If words didn't work, I could always fall back on trusty daggers and bow. This was my education. I may not know anything about magic or books, but I am street-smart and know how to get myself out of sticky situations. FH2 got me some jobs for the local thugs, and I was given the name FH3. I started with easy tasks: burglary. My dark skin helps me be unseen, and my speed and climbing ability allowed me to run when necessary. I then moved on to other work. I did some 'security' in the large cities, such as in the capital of Sengar. I also moved to assassinations, the pay was simply much better and allowed for more downtime in between.

We never stayed too long in the same city. Even during daytime activities, people would actively distrust us. As they say, "Khajiit sell wares": our wares were murder, burglary and security. Unfortunately, FH1 got caught in a burglary one day. Unbeknownst to her, she broke into the house of the son of the person of power in Sengar. She was promply sentenced to 5 years in prison, and was transferred to Itron. This broke FH2. He committed to making lotta dough in a short period of time and retired afterwards. Our handler was so nice to include a bonus in his pay. He moved back to Tabaxistad Gajalaka and set out to retire with the funds he had. Mom also returned after her sentence blablabla.

Young and naive as I was, I continued. I needed money anyway, my skills were made for this. I'm not that good with money, I like to spend it on more shiny and interesting stuff. See this beautiful shawm? Can't play it, looks beautiful. Similarly I used to have these gnomish clockwork devices - unfortunately I all lost them some time ago. Beautiful things.

I have grown up surrounded by racism, I'm used to it. However, I can't always accept it when it's against my people. I don't talk about this, but I've killed a tabaxi trader during a burglary before. I told the handler it was self-defense, but he died in his sleep. Shitty people deserve shitty deaths. If people aren't kind to me, then why should I be nice to them?

In recent years, I've done more of the same: travelling the districts in Eliria, taking on assignments to make ends meet, move to the next city. This is, until I met this lady Dalynn in a tavern in Wedal. She told me the story about lost documents, and she intends to find it and unravel its mysteries. She said it may contain old secrets about the realm! I've just done a revenge kill and have some money on me to survive for a few weeks. Fascinated by the story, and surprised by the friendliness, I joined her in her quest.

# King Abigor

Has a son, Prince Felix, who was raised in In√§sta at Oduins under the name of Magone. He's a good kid, but corruptable.

#### Politics

He the King.

#### Andarin Allegations  


According to the [Andarin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/link/14#bkmrk-page-title) Abigor found the secret to immortality 200 years ago.

After that, he started a war with the Andarin, whom he doesn't like. He cast a Mythall spell: Dracorage. This made all dragons go abserd, whiped all memories (about the Andarin and this war?) and severed the ties between the Andarin and the earth.

This is also claimed to be the reason why magic users and woman are repressed, as Abigor intends to hunt down every last Andarin.

We kinda think he not a good guy, cause Andarin be talking bout genocide.

+ Get told story:

    - Long ago, there was another race: [the Andarin](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-andarin).
    - They were the first humanoids in Darninia. Descendants from powerful celestials, some could change the sun.
    - This changed when king Abigor came into power 200 years ago.
    - History books say that he came into power 40 years ago, but the king before him is also Abigor. He is immortal.
    - He is scared of the Andarin and convinced all races to revolt against the Andarin, killing most of them. Only a few survived.
    - Abigor installed a Mythal-spell, creating a new history with a new god, Eureka. He stol the spell from "us".
    - The spell disconnected Andarin from the earth, preventing them from earth bending, although they can still perform magic.
    - Then Abigor found out some Andarin still live, and started discriminating against women and magic.

- The mysterious mark means you're Andarin.
- Cara = Andarin
- Armani has book about Andarin
- proof of fairy taile is in documents
- Mohul was married to Andarin, but forgot after Mythal, but they told him about it and now he believes them
- power of Mythal spell is diminishing
- symbol of power also shows on men
- struggle to believe the fairy tale, since there is no real proof

+ captured people are Andarin
+ captured by adventurers in a cave system - they are the witches we heard about before
+ one of the captured, [Culoriana](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/culorianacora), is an original Andarin, one of three who survived

- they are considering joining the voiceless
- sister tribe = 40ish people

+ the hald broken flute from Dalynn is the flute of [Iuna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/iuna)
+ was used to create the Darninian forest, used to communicate with the plants + animals
+ break the Mythal spell to unlock its full potential
+ prison is still in construction
+ intended to capture and hold magic users
+ most prisoners will work construction, important prisoners are not allowed to
+ give or take 20 guards
+ there was an archmage that put spells around the prison
+ currently mostly construction managers, so no real good guards

- plan:
    - Wacomar + Dalynn go in invisible, gather information on manager so Wacomar can impoersonate him
    - EotM + Faramar go up by the rope and kill guards
    - Wacomar + Dalynn release prisoners
    - then leave
- we get 300GP + magic items in return
- 150GP up front

+ first go to Armani and at nightfall do the prison break

- Wacomar + EotM talk to guards to disctract them while dalynn + Faramar head inside
- get caught, but bluff our way through
- Wacomar "suggest"s that they investigate rumours about tabaxi now

+ [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris) feels attracted to it, as if it is the music box he should get for papa

- low insight so we believe him

+ √ñfakk√∂ says black lotus is in cave of Wailing Drowned, not in the temple
+ says sphinx of black quartz =/= black lotus
+ sphinx came from the desert, tabaxi-land
+ says tabaxi lived here and then left when aaracockra came
+ they left behind gold/treasure
+ does not know why kalaaf has a temple underground/in a cave
+ folk tale that aaracockra before having wings lived in caves, and then got wings to escape the caves

- Wacomar waks up after getting the herb mixture
- Faramar tries to hide the egg from √ñfakk√∂, but he sees through the deception
- Fredrik tells about the egg

+ we need to find the fifth rune to get in the cae
+ we need to find the lotus in the cave to get feather fall for the fifth rune
+ does not compute

+ √ñfakk√∂ gives us a sign of Neuneun statue, says he stole it from the Veil and they'll give us featherfall potions in return

+ Wacomar went to sleep and dreamt signs from papa: "the egg is safe with the party, wait until you're in [Itron](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/itron), then get it back and you'll know what to do. This is one step closer to getting mum and me back to life"

- go to the Veil again
- give them the Neuneun statue and get the potions

# Session 14 - On a whole 'nother plane

- put runes in slows in the wall
- entrance in the wall opens
- √ñfakk√∂ does not join us in entering
- he is not the chosen one
- supposedly we all are

+ Fredrik sneaks forward to scout
+ Finds room with pillars, bookcases with books in Old [Darninia](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/darninia)n and Neuneun runes
+ pillars ahve roots around them that give off shadowy, smoky trails
+ also appearing and disappearing ghosts

- as the group follows, the wall closes behind us
- Fredrik sees a shiny object and rushes forward, but gets called back by the party
- Divine sense: roots are evil, but otherwise nothing
- investigate the roots:
    - come from another plane "Nine hells"
    - demonic
    - have been growing for centuries
- shiny object = shining black flower from metal
- has hinge in the middle as if it can be opened
- Fredrik opens it
- adamantine metal dagger protrudes from the rose
- it is a stiletto-rose

+ one book is open on a page about the flute that [Dalynn](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dalynn-lathrana) has
+ it is in Old Darninian, so take the book to see if someone can read it for us
+ Dalynn is putting books from the floor back in the bookcases
+ [Wacomar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/wacomar-illitris) looks through the flute-book, it mentions a few places, contains maps, pictures of vials, jewelry, the stiletto-rose and the flute, animals (including fairy-dragons)

- [Faramar](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/faramar-illitris) + Fredrik move to the next room
- altar with candelabra, silverware etc
- also a potion with flickering fluid
- big wings on a stand
- altar is encroached on by the roots, the entire room is filled with them
- only few pathways are left open
- move into the room
- Detect magic: wings + potion are illusions

+ Wacomar + Dalynn enter the room
+ Dalynn steps on a root
+ room darkens and hear a voice: "You are not welcome here"
+ dizzy feelings
+ suddenly we are in a different room
+ see a person in front of us
+ everyone sees a different persion:
+ Faramar + Wacomar see Heinz [von Mackenbach](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/the-von-mackenbach-family), he taunts them about their mom Esmeralda
+ Fredrik sees tabaxi traders who are trying to trap him
+ Dalynn sees her betrothed Rowan who claims she is his

- roll initiative!
- because we see different people, it looks weird if others attack
- as if they miss the attack but the person in front of us still looks hurt

+ when Fredrik lays the killing blow, the world trembles, our sight goes hazy and then blind as there suddenly is too much light
+ we're in a world with a lot of bright colours and coloured animals
+ Detect Magic is still on: sensory overload, as everything is magical, not from a specific school

- party looks different too:
- Wacomar is a Winter Eladrin
- Fredrik is a Spring Eladrin
- Faramar is a Summer Eladrin
- Dalynn is a Autumn Eladrin

+ During discussion of what is happening, Wacomar accidentally drops the name Heinz
+ Farmar saves the day by pretending Heinz is a trader in half-elves who tried to steal him

- every party member is wearing a necklace with different coloured crystals, cannot take it off but the necklace is not magical
- history check from Wacomar: we are in the Faewild, although it is a lot brighter than stories say it is
- everything is intensified
- Faewild is supposed to be the world of twilight, but the sun is shining

+ see houses in the distance
+ animals near us
+ Dalynn tries to add a colour-deer to her druid list of animal
+ scares away the first one
+ tries to look for a second one
+ suddenly the worlds shifts and we're back where we started
+ one of the crystals on the necklaces is burned
+ fives tries left

- hurry to the houses
- little girl approaches "finally! we have been waiting since like forever"
- brings us to a giant, Yggdrasil-like tree
- small house nearby, elven [woman](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/nalaya) at table
- asks for help with a banquet, the big tree is dying and one of the people is a traitor
- as if tree is being pulled to hell-ish places
- it is possible to enter the tree, but it is a holy place so last resort
- in one hour a feast will take place, where the council members will eat and one of them might be the traitor
- Dalynn plays the flute to connect to nature, feels the tree is hurt very badly
- cries

+ the woman gives us clothing for the banquet
+ 8 village elders at the table that invite us to join them
+ everything is a little bit strange, but it seems they expected us
+ Dalynn expected it to be twilight, but people don't know what twilight is
+ sun just *snap* is gone and then *snap* is back

- all alders are Eladrin too
- 1 blue, 2 green, 3 yellow, 2 red
- Divine sense: blue eladrin is a fiend
- Faramar picks a chair very close to the blue eladrin
- apparently switching places to talk to different people is very strange here, but the party covers for him
- try to talk to blue eladrin
- he leaves immediately to prepare for the spring feat
- his name is Henk
- ask other elder where the toilet is, to mask following Henk
- while leaving, give the rest of the party a pointed look
- they make up different excuses to leave and follow Faramar
- Henk enters a house in the forest

+ With Wacomars help, Faramar and Dalynn enter the house invisibly
+ Wacomar + [EotM](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/eye-of-the-mountain) stay outside
+ party is split up D:
+ Henk is not in the living room, quickly get the rest of the party inside
+ Henk is not in bedroom or kitchen either
+ find a trapdoor underneath a rug

- EotM lockpicks a box in the bedroom, finds scrolls inside
- scrolls are in Sylvan and talk about "being better than the rest", and "joining someone", and "seeing her"
- in exchange for killing the tree
- go through the trapdoor after EotM snatches some diamond earrings

+ enter mossy cave, Old Darninian writings on the wall
+ hear voices from a corridor, followed by a scream
+ corridor ends in a big, lit chamber with big, black root in the middle
+ same black roots as in Wailing Drowned cave
+ embedded gem in the root
+ 2 incubi are torturing the blue eladrin

- roll iniative!
- incubi are very charming, and kiss very well

+ their bodies disappear
+ blue eladrin claims to have been captured and tortured for months
+ take gem out of the tree
+ right then we are transported to the dark place again, out of the Faewild
+ look like ourselves again

- another person in front of us
- Faramar sees his mom Esmeralda, and a scary, beautiful Wacomar, stretching their hands out "join me"
- Wacomar sees his father "you woke up your mom, come and join me"
- Fredrik sees his father
- Dalynn sees her beloved Mathan and says "join me"
- Dalynn fails her wisdom save, goes to touch her beloved and is immediately downed

+ roll iniative!

- out of the dead demon body comes smoke, encircling us, and we're back in the Wailing Drowned cave again
- black roots are gone, crack appears in the roof so light shins on the altar
- vials and wings are real now
- Dalynn is not healable D:
- put Dalynns body on Faramars shoulders to see if √ñfakk√∂ can heal her

+ EotM takes a sip of the flickering fluid in the vial, now sees the temple as it was ages ago
+ people worshipping everywhere
+ no one responds to him
+ tries walking around but further away from the alter it gets hazy
+ sees andarin symbol on the altar

- √ñfakk√∂ says we had the "challenge of Kalaaf"
- why didn't he warn us?!
- says Dalynn has "corruption"
- his cousins can wake her up but there is no cure
- she will die in a week
- there used to be a cure, but nobody knows how to make it
- months ago there were "weird elves" (andarin?) who cured someone, but they left again
- they were looking for a red-haired woman

+ go back in temple with √ñfakk√∂
+ give him the potion, he takes a sip
+ wakes up from his vision, happy crying
+ he saw Kalaaf
+ had a different vision than EotM

- we came for a black lotus and hints about the documents
- black lotus is probably the stiletto-rose from EotM
- so we are done here

+ show √ñfakk√∂ the book
+ says it is written by the woman the weird elves were looking for, [Iuna](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/iuna)
+ √ñfakk√∂ brings out a satchel with a lot of potions
+ flies us back one-by-one
+ storm is apparently gone from Stormtunnel
+ apparently a really big deal, and we evade aaracockra on our way down
+ in town we hear bells ringing
+ first wake Dalynn up
+ head to Rusty Talon, on our way hear aaracockra talking about the storm being gone
+ go to backroom of Rusty Talon
+ R√§k√§n gets out mortar and pestle, makes a paste out of black flowers
+ Dalynn wakes up, feels very bad but is still alive
+ hearing about the corruption is a shock for her

- go to Thoran's refuge to get [Dandy](https://bookstack.hemels.me/books/Darninia/page/dandy) (and the egg)
- Dandy notices Dalynns illness and gets sad

+ got to palace with √ñfakk√∂
+ it's gated and a lot of guards are defending it from the mob trying to enter
+ Wacomar walks up to a guard to try and talk his way in
+ doesn't work
+ √ñfakk√∂ only wants to enter the palace because he hopes to get his ban restored

- head to the temple
- √ñfakk√∂ is let in, but not treated very nicely
- a pair of guards come in to tie his hands
- show priests the wings of Kalaaf
- "I've been trying to tell you all these years, but do you ever listen? No, no, you never do!" - √ñfakk√∂
- priests are now convinces √ñfakk√∂ is right
- they're very interested in the wings

+ also very interested in the black lotus
+ the petals allegedly hold a lot of power
+ they offer 2000GP for both wings and black lotus
+ drive the price up to 3200GP
+ √ñfakk√∂ is disappointed with us but we get money
+ get a big chest filled with GP/Sp/Cp
+ give √ñfakk√∂ the rest of the potion, keep a few drops, so we can try and recreate the potion

> "Eerst was ik een hoer, maar nu ben ik een blanke, witte man" - Frank

+ go to Imperial Bank to have money counted and transformed to platinum pieces
+ they only handle stuff for members
+ Wacomar as Thomas tries to open an account
+ give the chest while they are checking Thomas' identity
+ it doesn't check out
+ they want 100GP to count and convert it
+ Thomas bluffs his way through to the member discount anyway (1%)
+ EotM gets the egg from Thoran
+ We exchanged 3267GP, paid a fee of 33GP, and received 323PP and 4GP

- to Stormhorn
- tailor is closed
- head to tavern nearby

+ Heurits & Meurits are sitting in the tavern
+ get Meurits to exchange the cloak for 325GP now
+ pay the barkeep to give them as much beer as they want as an extra thank you

- Faramar and EotM play darts to see if Faramar will help EotM
